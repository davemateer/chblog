# Everything is meaningless “under the sun”

This fall we’ve been considering what God’s Word has to say to us around the
theme of “the quest for significance”. Where is it that we should root our
identity and value? We are going to be continuing that theme tonight by looking
at the book of Ecclesiastes. Ecclesiastes is in the center of your Bible. If you
open to the center you will probably be in Psalms or Proverbs. This is part of
the Bible called “wisdom literature”. Proverbs is what we typically think of
when we think of wisdom: short, pithy sayings that commend positive behavior and
warn us against foolish behavior. The very next book is Ecclesiastes. This is
also wisdom literature, instructing us in how to live, but it goes about that
instruction in a very different way.

For the past few months, we’ve been doing some remodeling work in our basement.
We knocked out a bunch of things to clear some room and are adding an additional
bedroom. Now, because this isn’t something I do for a living, most of the time I
don’t have a clue what I’m doing. But … hooray for YouTube! There are tons of
instructional videos out there to help you along. Most of these are showing you
the right way to do things. But I’ve also been helped by videos that show you
the consequences of doing something the wrong way. “If you cut corners and put
up the drywall panels in this incorrect way, here is the mess you are going to
have down the road. Don’t do that.”

Ecclesiastes can be helpful to us in this same negative-case-study way. In much
of the book the author gives us an account of his unsuccessful “quest for
significance”. The point is, you don’t have to repeat the same mistakes.
So—spoiler alert—the author tells us his conclusion right from the beginning:

> “Meaningless! Meaningless!” says the Teacher. “Utterly meaningless! Everything
> is meaningless.” What do people gain from all their labors at which they toil
> under the sun?

The first thing I want us to notice is that phrase at the end of verse 3, “under
the sun”. This phrase shows up over and over throughout the book of
Ecclesiastes. It sets the stage for us and takes us back to two weeks ago when
we looked at Genesis 2 and 3, when Adam and Eve sinned against God. And as we
saw then, that historical event was the cause of all the brokenness and misery
we have in the world today.

- The earth itself is cursed so that it frustrates efforts to cultivate it, and
  we have natural disasters like floods and earthquakes.
- Our hearts are inclined towards evil so that we mistrust and exploit others.
- The result? Fractured relationships, famine, injustice, poverty, racism, war,
  pain, sickness, suffering.
- And the ultimate consequence of our rebellion against God, just as He warned,
  is death. The end of every single one of us in this room is to return to dust.

That’s what we mean by life “under the sun.” It is a worldview that looks no
further than this broken and cursed world in which we spend a few short, hard
years and then die.

# History is circular

And here’s what life is like under the sun—in this broken and cursed world.

> What do people gain from all their labors  
> &emsp;at which they toil under the sun?  
> Generations come and generations go,  
> &emsp;but the earth remains forever.  
> The sun rises and the sun sets,  
> &emsp;and hurries back to where it rises.  
> The wind blows to the south  
> &emsp;and turns to the north;  
> round and round it goes,  
> &emsp;ever returning on its course.  
> All streams flow into the sea,  
> &emsp;yet the sea is never full.  
> To the place the streams come from,  
> &emsp;there they return again.  
> All things are wearisome,  
> &emsp;more than one can say.  
> The eye never has enough of seeing,  
> &emsp;nor the ear its fill of hearing.  
> What has been will be again,  
> &emsp;what has been done will be done again;  
> &emsp;there is nothing new under the sun.  
> Is there anything of which one can say,  
> &emsp;“Look! This is something new”?  
> It was here already, long ago;  
> &emsp;it was here before our time.  
> No one remembers the former generations,  
> &emsp;and even those yet to come  
> will not be remembered  
> &emsp;by those who follow them. (Ecclesiastes 1:3-11)

We’re given a bunch of analogies from nature. Suppose you are standing on the
bank of the Ohio River in Beaver or Bridgewater at the mouth of one of those
tiny streams that empties into the river. And if you watch, it never stops.
Water is constantly racing around rocks, swirling, bubbling, moving into the
river. And if you’d follow that river, it too is in constant motion, eventually
joining with the Mississippi River. And you could follow that down as it, too,
is in constant activity, ultimately emptying into the Gulf of Mexico and the
Atlantic Ocean.

But the ocean never fills up. All of that activity makes no appreciable
difference whatsoever to the water level. It doesn’t change. We understand the
water cycle, so we can understand why. The water evaporates from the ocean,
condenses in the clouds, we have precipitation and the streams start all over
again. Round and round and round it goes, ever full of activity but coming right
back again to the same place over and over.

So it seems with our lives. We are constantly active—going to school, going to
work, writing books, building skyscrapers, creating newer and faster computers,
and yet nothing fundamentally changes the brokenness of the world: there’s still
injustice, poverty, war, bullying, gossip, broken families, broken
relationships, sickness, death. There is nothing new.

That’s the hard truth: if your world view is limited to “under the sun”—if you
can see no further than this broken and cursed world in which you live for a
moment and then are gone, what purpose can there be in life?

# What do we do about it?

What do we do, then, with this sense of futility and lack of purpose?

## Option 1: Distraction

In a minute we’re going to look at two ways in which the author of Ecclesiastes
attempted to find meaning and satisfaction. And as we’re going to see, it
doesn’t turn out very well. But before we criticize, let’s at least give some
credit where credit is due: he made the effort. He actually thought deeply about
the ultimate questions of life and applied himself fully to resolve it. And
that’s more than we can say for many, perhaps most, people.

You see, the most common response (if we can call it that) to the problem of the
futility of life in this cursed world is just to ignore it—we just don’t give it
much thought. “Hakuna Matata!” “I’m sure it will turn out all right in the end.”
Go to school. Go to work. Come home. Turn on the TV. Play a game. Take a walk.
Listen to music. Hang out with friends. Not bad things, but we can be so content
with the normal things of life that we just don’t care enough to ask the tough
questions.

The fact that you are here tonight, I hope, indicates that at some level you are
asking the tough questions. “What in the world am I doing here on earth?” I hope
that’s true for every one of you. Look, and if that’s not you—if you are just
here because a friend dragged you and are thinking, “Hoo boy, this is weird”,
we’re glad you are here. But I just want to encourage you: you are a rational
human being, capable of observing and thinking deeply. The fact that you are
here tonight is no accident. You have other students and adults here who care
about you and are willing to discuss with you any questions you may have about
life and meaning. We may not have the answers—we often don’t—but our commitment
is to help find those answers with you. To go throughout life without ever
seeking answers to the ultimate questions of life is a tragedy. We hope that
tonight you start that journey.

## Option 2: Seek purpose in wisdom and knowledge

So if you return to the text we’ll take a look at two of the ways that our
author attempted to find meaning. And in verse 12 we are introduced to our
author—the King of Jerusalem. Ecclesiastes is written from the perspective of
King Solomon, and that helps us to understand this section. We don’t have time
tonight to go into his history, but you can read all about it in some of the
historical books of the Bible. Two points to make here, though. First, Solomon
was brilliant. Other nations came to him to seek advice, he ruled his kingdom
with extreme shrewdness, he wrote tons of proverbs, etc. Second, and related to
the first, is that Solomon was wealthy beyond measure. He could literally have
anything we wanted. And as we’ll see in a moment, he did just that.

Look first, though, at where Solomon’s knowledge and wisdom gets him when
considering life under the sun:

> I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. I applied my mind to study
> and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy
> burden God has laid on mankind! I have seen all the things that are done under
> the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
>
> What is crooked cannot be straightened;  
> &emsp;what is lacking cannot be counted.
>
> I said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has
> ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and
> knowledge.” Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of
> madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.
>
> For with much wisdom comes much sorrow;  
> &emsp;the more knowledge, the more grief. (Ecclesiastes 1:12-18)

We have some absolutely brilliant students in this room tonight. And praise God
for that. And what we’re talking about here isn’t strictly book knowledge.
That’s part of it, but it is wisdom in general. Figuring out how things tick.
The ability to read and connect with people. There is tons in the Bible that
commends such application of knowledge and wisdom, but here we are confronted
with its limitations. Look at the proverb in verse 15:

- **What is crooked cannot be straightened.** Understanding something doesn’t
  necessarily mean one can do anything about it. I might be able to fully
  understand the science of tornados, but that knowledge doesn’t at all help the
  family whose house has just been destroyed. I can study the social
  consequences of injustice, but that fundamentally doesn’t change the reality
  of injustice that issues from a corrupt heart.

- **What is lacking cannot be counted.** This points to our limited knowledge.
  Another way of putting this would be, “You can’t count what isn’t there.”
  There are just some mysteries that are beyond our ability to understand.

Moreover, and ironically enough, sometimes increasing knowledge only increases
the grief. If you never give it any thought, you can always console yourself
with, “Well, I’m sure it’s not that bad; someone else will figure it out.” When
you know with certainty how bad things are and how powerless you are, that can
increase the grief.

## Option 3: Indulge in pleasure

Next, Solomon turns to pleasure.

> I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is
> good.” But that also proved to be meaningless. “Laughter,” I said, “is
> madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?” I tried cheering myself with
> wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to
> see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of
> their lives.
>
> I undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. I
> made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. I made
> reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. I bought male and female
> slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds
> and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. I amassed silver and gold for
> myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female
> singers, and a harem as well—the delights of a man’s heart. I became greater
> by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with
> me.
>
> I denied myself nothing my eyes desired;  
> &emsp;I refused my heart no pleasure.  
> My heart took delight in all my labor,  
> &emsp;and this was the reward for all my toil.  
> Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done  
> &emsp;and what I had toiled to achieve,  
> everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;  
> &emsp;nothing was gained under the sun.
>
> Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom,  
> &emsp;and also madness and folly.  
> What more can the king’s successor do  
> &emsp;than what has already been done?

Look at the things in which Solomon sought pleasure, and remember the earlier
comment that there is nothing new under the sun.

- Alcohol
- Comedy (laughter)
- Work (great building projects)
- Amassing stuff (slaves, herds, flocks, silver, gold)
- Music (singers)
- Sex (harem; explain Solomon’s wives and concubines)

And what did he find? That when you live purely for selfish pleasure, it’s
empty. It doesn’t really satisfy, and you still die and leave it all behind;
nothing is gained.

And people of every generation learned this lesson over and over and over. And
the next generation has to learn it over and over and over. You don’t have to go
down this road. Listen to those who have already gone down it and found it ends
in disillusion.

# What God has done about it

How do we solve this problem of the meaninglessness of life? We don’t. God has
provided the solution.

When we open up our worldview beyond “under the sun”, we see that history is
not, in fact, circular. Ecclesiastes kind of leaves us hanging. Even if you read
the entire book, it stays fairly pessimistic. But Ecclesiastes isn’t the whole
story. It is part of a larger story that shows that history is not circular but
linear, that God is working out a plan.

Go through timeline: Creation, Fall (promise of deliverer), Abraham (promise of
deliverer), Moses, Solomon, Jesus (new; fulfillment), church…

1977 – I was born and became part of this story (amazing!); 1995 – confess;
believe -> adopted

199x-200x – You became part of this story…

As we go into small group, this is part of what we can be thinking about. What
is your role in this story?
