# The Church as Family

Very often, especially in the New Testament, the Bible refers to what’s going on
here as “family”. One of the primary ways that the Bible explains what has
happened to us in Christ is that we have been adopted into his family.
Spiritually speaking, if you are here today as a follower of Jesus Christ, then
I am your brother, and you are my brother or sister. John 1:12 puts it this
way:, “to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave
the right to become children of God.”

That’s worth a moment’s reflection to set the stage of the passage this morning.
The primary metaphor in the Scripture for how we relate to one another is
family. Not a business. Not an organization. Family. Certainly there are
organizational and business-like aspects to what’s going on here—we see some of
those in the verses about caring for widows—but the driving metaphor—what should
drive our motivation—is that of family.

We acknowledge, of course, that earthly families have their share of drama and
brokenness. And in many cases, tragically, outright dysfunction or even abuse
where trust has been violated. So this analogy of family can be a struggle for
some, but I think even with such brokenness, we intrinsically understand what
family is **supposed** to be like. I think that’s why Scripture can so
often—without apology—portray the body of Jesus’ followers as a family. There
was family brokenness back in the first century as well, but this is the
illustration we are given repeatedly.

And that’s how our passage opens, with the reminder to treat one another as
family. That applies to everyone, and we can fill in what that might look like:
respect, protection, meeting practical needs, etc. And there are also two
specific things that are called out here, so let’s take a quick look at those
before moving into the heart of the passage about widows.

## Respect for Elders … Even in Correction

The first is an extra measure of deference that should be given to those who are
older. Note, however, that this does **not** mean unquestioned obedience. In
fact, the context is assuming that it will be necessary at times for those who
are younger to correct those who are older, but that there is a proper way to go
about it. “Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your
father.” Recognize that maybe, just maybe, there’s some accumulated wisdom that
you lack. So less, “You’re wrong, boomer” and perhaps more, “Hey, I’m not sure I
agree on that. Can you tell me how you came to that conclusion?”

## With Absolute Purity

The other distinction that this passage calls out is to treat younger women
“with absolute purity.” Here I think the Bible is simply acknowledging the
tragic reality that it is younger females who are disproportionately the target
of lust and victims of sexual exploitation. In the church.

What does it look like to treat them “with absolute purity”? Among other
things—in our pornified culture—that means continually being clear in our
minds—men, younger and older—that young women are not to be objectified, but
bear the precious image of God. Which then I think has practical ramifications.
Although it’s not spelled out clearly here, so I’m a bit outside of Scripture on
this point, I think there is a heck of a lot of wisdom in things like “The Billy
Graham Rule” where men just shouldn’t be meeting 1-on-1 with women unless it is
in a public area, or—taking a cue from this passage—maybe if that woman is old
enough to be your own mom. Again, I’m here; Bible there. That’s not a command
from God, and we have to be careful about rules and legalism. But we also have
to be careful not to be stupid. Treating younger women “with absolute purity”
means something, let’s keep that in mind.

# Widows

Now the whole rest of the entire passage, from verses 3 through 16, concerns a
special member of that church family, specifically the one who is bereft of her
entire earthly family, the widow.

It would be incorrect to say that every widow in the first century was in
desperate straits. Women could own property and many held positions of influence
in society even after their husbands had died. But it is also true that
financial stability and social connectedness **tended** to follow the male and
so many widows could and did find themselves on the margins. And thus they
deserved special recognition in the church.

And this is certainly not the only place in Scripture where God reveals the
priority he places on caring for those on the margins. One well-known passage
from the New Testament reminds us that

> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look
> after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being
> polluted by the world. (James 1:26)

Nor is this just a New Testament thing. This is a recurring concern that God
revealed to His people throughout all of their history. Some examples:

> Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of
> the fatherless; plead the case of the widow. (Isaiah 1:17)
>
> A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling.
> (Psalm 68:5)

# Discernment / Saying “No”

Now, **that’s** the sermon I want to preach. That’s actually the sermon I
thought I would be preaching before studying the text. There is so much good
stuff throughout the Bible on how the heart of God is revealed through the
provision he makes and commands he gives for the caring of orphans and widows.

But as we look at this passage—and you may have noticed this as we were reading
through—that’s not really the main point of the passage. At least not directly.
Paul is assuming that the church understands the priority of caring for widows.
In fact, from what we read here they were already doing so, but apparently they
were going about it in a way that lacked some discernment. The instruction in
this passage is actually focused around who not to support, urging the church to
draw a distinction between those who qualify and those who do not.

This focus is evident in the way the section both opens and closes. We’re told
in verse 3 to “Honor widows who are really in need” or, as the ESV puts it,
widows who are “truly widows.” Verse 16 concludes with the same phrase. So there
are widows in the technical sense—they have lost their husbands—but who
nonetheless are not “truly widows” in the sense qualified by this passage.

Broadly speaking, Paul provides two reasons why we must be discerning and make
distinctions in this area. Let’s cover the first reason quickly, which is called
out most directly in that last verse 16: “Let the church not be burdened, so
that it may care for those who are truly widows.” Here is the very practical and
simple explanation that the church has limited resources. It’s not that Paul’s
against the support of widows. Precisely the opposite. If the church says “yes”
to every request, there’s nothing left by the time it gets to those who really
need it.

We should pause there a second for some application. There’s a general principle
here that applies beyond caring for widows, right? Stewardship. This is true as
a church, and as individuals. There are thousands of missionaries and charities
and individuals who are worthy of our financial support. Dozens and dozens of
programs, initiatives, and ministry opportunities to which we could devote our
limited time and resources. But if we’re not deliberate and discerning, the
tendency is to end up with squeaky wheel syndrome. Where we end up spending our
resources where the complaints are the loudest or with whomever has the largest
marketing budget, and we end up short changing those things that should be
priority. It’s important to invest in the most important things, which means
saying “No” to a lot more.

So that’s the first reason Paul says that it’s necessary to make distinctions:
to be a good steward of limited resources.

The second general reason that Paul gives for the need to be discerning is that
it can actually end up harming the person we’re trying to help. We’ll look more
at that as we get to those verses.

# True Widows: Future Prospects

So who does and who does not qualify as “a widow who is really in need”? There
are basically three criteria that Paul gives here: (1) the lack of a support
system, (2) her character, and (3) a specific age requirement. I want to skip
ahead a bit and talk about that last one first, because that’s the thorniest
issue I think in this passage and gets a bit technical, but I think it also
helps us contextualize this passage.

At first glance it looks like there is a straight-up contradiction here. Paul
puts the age of the qualifying widow (in verse 9) at sixty years of age. And
then note in verse 11 that Paul announces condemnation for the remarrying widow:
“For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want
to marry. Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their
first pledge.” But then in verse 14 Paul counsels that younger widows should
remarry. What’s the deal?

I propose, with some trepidation, that there is something going on here that’s
not quite possible to bring directly into our modern culture. I say “with
trepidation” because in general we tend to way overuse the “that was then; this
is now“ cultural relevance argument. It’s an easy card to play when we don’t
agree with something in Scripture.

That being said, I think this is one case where it’s pretty hard to make sense
of the passage unless you figure in some dynamics of this church where Timothy
is, that may not be true of our churches today.

And we can see that in the various references throughout this passage to “the
list”. Or if you have an ESV, it talks about widows being “enrolled” into
something. It seems that this list wasn’t simply a database of those for whom
the church was providing support, but involved some sort of covenant or pledge
on the part of the widow. A promise that seemed to involve service to the church
and—apparently—a commitment not to remarry.

If that’s true, this isn’t necessarily something that the New Testament church
invented. Recall the example of Anna, whom we meet when the child Jesus is taken
to the temple for dedication. We are told that “She was very old; she had lived
with her husband seven years after her marriage, and then was a widow until she
was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting
and praying.”

This is all a bit speculative, but that seems to me a reasonable way to
understand what might be going on here. In which case, Paul is saying that it
would be rash and foolish for a younger widow to enter into such a binding
pledge, unless—like Anna—she is truly called into such a ministry. Rather—no
doubt after an appropriate time of grief—she should feel free to remarry.

And that can help us navigate this passage. There are solid general principles
here, and absolutely the care of widows remains a priority for the church. But
the application may not be exactly one-to-one, as this pledge-type relationship
isn’t anything practiced—as far as I am aware—in any church today.

# True Widows: No Support System

Skipping back up, the first line of provision Paul notes is the widow’s own
family. Verse 4 says that the children and grandchildren of a widow should put
their religion into practice by repaying their parents and grandparents.

This is the general cycle of dependency. When one is a child, of course, one is
completely dependent upon others for basic needs to be met such as food,
shelter, companionship, and navigating the dynamics of an ever-changing world.
This dependence (ideally) diminishes as one grows into adulthood and
independence.

But it often reaches a crossover point, does it not? Where the children and
grandchildren are now the ones responsible to assist with the needs of their
parents and grandparents, often in similar ways: food, shelter, companionship,
and navigating the dynamics of an ever-changing world. This is part of what it
means to honor one’s parents, beyond what that looks like as a young child.

This command is so strong that Paul would say that anyone who does not provide
for their relatives has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. Dang,
Paul! I don’t think this is saying that someone is losing their salvation so
much as it is calling out that in their self-absorption they’re just not
connecting the dots. I think of the parable that Jesus shared about the man who
was forgiven a huge, unimaginable debt but then can’t find the compassion to
forgive someone else who owes him a much smaller debt. So likewise here, to have
such a vivid picture in the Gospel of being rescued from a state of complete
dependence, but then to refuse to meet practical needs of one’s own relatives in
their time of need, exposes that something isn’t clicking. Even pagans take care
of their own. It’s a denial of the faith one claims to believe in.

# True Widows: Character

The final qualification is the widow’s character. Verse 5 says that she “puts
her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help.” In
verse 9, we’re told that she has been “faithful to her husband”—the phrase here
is the same as that in chapter 3 when looking at the qualifications for
elders—and she “is well known for her good deeds”, of which several examples are
given (“bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the
Lord’s people, helping those in trouble”).

Here we’re reminded that not all charity cases are appropriate for the church.
Galatians 6 reminds us to “do good to all, but especially those of the household
of faith”. The priority for the church is the church.

But even beyond the reality of limited resources, providing financial support
can actually be harmful in some cases. That seems to be what’s going on with
some of the (very) harsh words Paul has about some of these widows who shouldn’t
qualify. In verse 13 Paul calls them out as “they get into the habit of being
idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers,
but also busybodies who talk nonsense, saying things they ought not to.”

We’re again reading between the lines a bit here, but I don’t think it takes too
much imagination to see what’s going on. The church in Ephesus hasn’t been
discerning enough when it comes to charity. And now there are people who have no
allegiance to Christ or His church who have gotten themselves on the dole of the
church with “no strings attached”. With all their physical needs provided for by
the church, they have nothing better to do than gossip. In fact, verse 13 more
literally can be translated, “They learn to be idle.” Help given in the wrong
way can actually **train** people into patterns that are to their ultimate harm.

In verse 6 the unqualified widow “lives for pleasure” and “is dead even while
she lives.” Meaning that, yes, physical life goes on, but spiritually she is
dead. There’s no future there. And the church here is enabling that
self-indulgent lifestyle.

# Conclusion

Whew. Well, that ended up being kind of a downer of a message, huh? But let’s
not miss the forest for the trees. The restrictions are in place so that
ultimately we are free to be most effective in the ways we—as individuals and as
a church—are investing our time, gifts, and resources.

So how do we apply this? Again, this can be a tough one that takes some
contextualization. Here are some suggestions.

- Treat one another in the church like family.

- Take care of the needs of your family. Going both ways. Parents for children.
  Children for parents.

- Care for those on the margins (including widows). Maybe, with things like
  Social Security, the financial distress in our culture isn’t as extreme, but
  certainly things like companionship, providing transportation, etc. are still
  acute needs.

- Be generous **and** discerning in your charity.
