  We’ve probably all heard at one point—or said ourselves—the saying, “God hates
  sin, but loves the sinner.” Is that a true or false statement?

We’ve probably all heard at one point—or said ourselves—the saying, “God hates
sin, but loves the sinner.” I want to frame our meditation on this passage in
Romans around the consideration of whether that is a true or false statement.
(And don’t worry, I’m not going to do that thing where I ask you to raise your
hands if you think it’s true, and then if it’s false, only to reveal, “Haha!
Trick question! The answer is actually Cleveland!” I hate when speakers do
that.)

At the end of the day, it is kind of a trick question. As we’re going to see in
this passage, there’s a sense in which it is both true and false—false in a way
that can give people false hope and cheapen the holiness of God—but also more
true than people realize, in way that profoundly reveals the depth of the love
of God.

# God’s wrath against the ungodly

So let’s take the low-hanging fruit first. As to the first part, “God hates
sin,” there’s no ambiguity there. As we’ve walked through especially the first 3
chapters, we’ve gotten plenty of reminders of God’s opinion on rebellion and
disobedience, on sin. That’s pretty much the theme of those early chapters. As a
reminder, one of the high points (low points?) is the proclamation in chapter 1
that _“The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the
godlessness and wickedness of people.”_ God is perfectly holy, and that holiness
demands that he despises sin. So yes, God hates sin.

But what about loving the sinner? Very often when that is said in our culture,
what people mean is that—even though God disapproves of someone’s sin, His love
is His dominant characteristic, and that love will win out over His sense of
justice or holiness in the end. He’s like a parent whose child has stolen a
cookie out of the cookie jar when they were told not to. Yeah, he’s
disappointed, and wishes that his child would choose honestly, but—”Ah, shucks”
and “Gee, Wally”—that’s his child so he loves him anyway.

I’m sorry—and I know that this offends many in our culture today—but that is
simply not the truth that Scripture reveals about God. To look at but one
example in Psalm 5:5–6:

> The arrogant cannot stand in your presence. You hate all who do wrong; you
> destroy those who tell lies. The bloodthirsty and deceitful you, Lord, detest.

God’s wrath is directed not just abstractly at sin, but specifically at us, at
sinners, at people.

Similarly, look at our passage this morning, in verse one: _“Since we have been
justified by faith, we have peace with God…”_ Note what it says there. It does
not say that we have “the peace **of** God,” that is, a calmness and a restful
spirit. That, of course, also would be a true statement—”peace” is one of the
fruits of the Spirit after all, but that’s not the point of this passage. The
point here is that through Jesus Christ we have peace **with** God. A truce, as
it were, has been negotiated. Before Jesus, we did not have that peace. In fact
verse 10 says that we were reconciled to God while we were his **enemies**.
Verse 9 says that we have been saved from God’s **wrath**.

So from this angle, “God hates sin, but loves the sinner” is a false statement.
Scripture impresses upon us that God’s wrath abides on the wicked, and as we saw
in chapter 3 of Romans, that’s all of us. _“There is no one righteous, not even
one.”_

# God’s love demonstrated in Christ

But, like I said earlier, there’s nuance that’s required. Because God’s wrath
isn’t the end of the story, is it? And that’s the glorious truth that is the
focus of this passage. Yes, we were in conflict with God. Yes, we were his
enemies. Yes, his wrath was justly upon us. But right there, that’s when God—in
his love—intervened.

I was captivated by that little phrase in verse 6 _“at just the right time,”_
because what follows in this passage—from a worldly point of view—is exactly the
**wrong** time. At least according to the way I usually live out my life. When
am I going to help somebody? To make it more personal, what’s the right time for
me to help **you**?

- When we’re closer—then I’ll help you—not when we’re estranged.
- When I believe this is going to be a mutually-rewarding relationship—then I’ll
  help you—not when I believe you have nothing to offer me.
- When you respect me—then I’ll help you—not when you hold me in contempt.

But God, looking at us, decided that the right time was while we were **weak**
(powerless, v.6). There was nothing we could do or offer to God. While we were
**ungodly**. Right in the middle of us choosing to reject God’s commands and
make him a priority in our lives. While we were (verse 8) **sinners**. **That**
was the right time. **That’s** when Christ died for us.

You sometimes hear things … well intentioned sayings like, “When you look at
Jesus dying on the cross, that just shows you how valuable you are. That he
would die on the cross for you.” And I get what people mean by that. We’re all
created in the image of God, so there’s intrinsic value there. But in another
sense, like this passage is saying, do you see how that’s completely backwards?
The whole point of grace is that I **wasn’t** worth it. I’m not worth of the
death of Christ. That happened for me—and for each of you—when we were weak,
powerless, enemies, sinners. That’s how God’s love was demonstrated.

So, one final time: does God love the sinner? YES! Not by overlooking sin but by
taking the initiative--by paying the penalty through Christ on our behalf.

It’s a classic for a reason, but John 3:16 states it well:

> “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
> believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”

# Future Hope

And it’s that love of God--not because of who we are but in spite of it--that is
the anchor for our future hope. Verses 9 and 10 give two examples of a “from the
lesser to the greater” argument. That is, “If X is true, then how much more will
Y be true!” And these both take the form of things that are true in the past and
present being the proof that our future is secure.

> Since we have now [present tense] been justified by his blood, how much more
> shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him [future]! For if, while we were
> God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son [past],
> how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life
> [future]!

This is the great problem that consumes much of the book of Romans. What do we
do with the wrath of God? We’ve already seen that God is perfectly holy, and
cannot simply ignore sin. We’ve already seen that we all fall short. We are all
marching day-after-day, towards death, and after that comes the judgment. Do we
then have to live in anxiety each and every day of our lives, hoping that at the
end we’ll be good enough to avoid God’s wrath, or that maybe he’ll just overlook
it?

No! Because of what God has already done in our past and present, we can have
confident hope to be saved from God’s wrath on that future day.

# Hope developed through suffering

Oh, and now I wish that it only required us to sit and think upon those truths,
and that would form the deepest convictions of that hope. It’s good to do that,
of course, but that’s not where the deepest convictions are formed…

But I skipped a part of this passage, didn’t I? Probably the most well-known
part of this chapter. And this part of the passage provides a more sobering but
realistic assessment. Deep-seated hope is often most effectively formed through
the crucible of our suffering. Verses 3 and 4:

> We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces
> perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope.

You know, we’re at the start of a new year, when many of us take the opportunity
to set goals or resolutions for the year to come. And I think for most of us,
the things at the end of this list might be goals we would shoot for. To be
persons of perseverance, to be persons of character, to be full of hope. But
what, according to this passage, is the door that opens us up to reaching those
goals? Suffering. And I think that’s where we start to get into trouble.

A little digression on suffering, but I think it’s necessary to fully appreciate
what this passage is getting at…. Broadly speaking, we can categorize suffering
into three buckets.

First is the suffering that we inflict upon ourselves because of our
foolishness. The proverbs especially are full of these warnings. Laziness leads
to poverty. Fooling around with another man’s wife leads to all kinds of pain
and reproach. Certainly we can learn from our mistakes, but that’s not the kind
of suffering in view in this passage, the kind that leads to perseverance,
character, and hope.

Another form of suffering is that which comes upon us because of the brokenness
of the world in general, because all of creation groans under the weight of sin.
Sickness. The death of a loved one. The proverbs note that laziness leads to
poverty, but that’s not the only cause of poverty, is it? Poverty and hardship
can be caused by corrupt systems, being taken advantage of, or simply economic
realities…the untimely closing of a factory, etc. This type of suffering is
closer to what Paul has in mind. Certainly they can build in us perseverance and
character. And build in us a hope in the sense of a longing for our reunion with
God.

And in any group larger than 4 people, statistically-speaking, someone is going
through such a bitter time. And if you find yourself there this morning, that is
perhaps your point of application today.

But without taking anything away from that, if we’re following the thought of
Paul across the entire letter, I think the suffering most directly in view here
is the type of suffering called out in chapter 8:

> Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with
> Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share
> in his glory. I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing
> with the glory that will be revealed in us. (Romans 8:17–18)

This form of suffering is a direct result of our association with, and
allegiance to, Christ. And this is where the application of our passage in
Romans 5 can get very complicated.

You see—thinking back to setting goals—if we went around the room and all
answered the question, “What is your greatest ambition? Who do you want to be?”
What would you say? Now since we’re in church, we know the right answer,
correct? We want to be godly. We want to be obedient to Christ. If you are
particularly theological, you might even recite the answer from the Westminster
Shorter Catechism: “Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him
forever.” Those are our goals, right?

And those are all great and appropriate answers. That’s exactly how I believe
most of us would respond here, in this place, if asked directly. But if I’m
honest, as I exit this building and live out the other 160 plus hours of my
week, too often my actions and words betray different priorities. If others were
asked, after watching me for a week, “What’s his primary goal in life?”, what
would they say? If my every thought were made public, what would that reveal in
terms of what I’m really aiming for?

And I think very often, the goal would be revealed to be something like:

- I want to be comfortable.
- I want to be free of drama and difficulty.
- I want to be in control.
- I want to be noticed and respected.

And do you see how those goals can short-circuit the process outlined in verses
3 and 4?

You see, there’s nothing I can really do to prevent suffering from the
brokenness of the world. No matter how much kale I eat or sit ups I do, I can
still get that call from the doctor. But there are definitely things I can do to
avoid the suffering that comes from allegiance to Christ. And I will choose
those shortcuts if my actual highest priorities are to be comfortable and
respected.

We need passages like the one before us this morning to recalibrate our minds.
And I’m not a prophet nor a son of a prophet, but I think it’s highly likely
we’ll be called to make this choice more often as the years go on, and with
potentially higher stakes. We’ve moved in our culture from a place where
Christian morality was dominant (and yes, there were abuses of power there that
rightly should be criticized), to where it was respected, to where it was
tolerated, to the place now where increasingly you and I are seen as obstacles
to progress. We’re getting in the way of the cultural agenda.

And so we’ll be called to make the same types of decisions that these early
Christians had to make and, quite frankly, that most of the Christians in the
world have had to make for some time. To consider the reproach of Christ greater
than the treasures of America.

And that unlocks the development in this passage. While we were enemies, God
reconciled us to himself in Christ. How do we know if we have received that
reconciliation? Here’s one way. When we choose to suffer while steadfastly
maintaining our allegiance to Christ, this develops in us perseverance. As we
hold on to that perseverance, this forms our character, our core identity: “I am
someone who belongs to God.” And that, in turn, fuels our hope. “Wow, I really
am someone who belongs to God! My future is secure!” May we all have the
empowerment of the Spirit to live that out, to the degree that God calls us to
it, in our lives this year.
