# Introduction

Good morning. If you have your Bibles, turn to the second chapter of Colossians.
We’re going to be focusing this morning on verses 6 through 15 … sort of.

Here’s the deal: **We**, in our modern day, go through the Bible section by
section each week, digesting a little at a time. And that’s generally a good
thing, allowing us to take our time thinking through God’s Word. But in some
ways that can also be a disservice. Think about it this way: when the letter to
the Colossians was originally received by the church in the first century, they
didn’t read one paragraph the first week, then another paragraph the next, and
so on. The whole book of Colossians **was** the sermon! And there is continuity
that can sometimes be lost when we divide up the text.

And I think that’s what we have to be careful about here. Really, all of chapter
2 through the beginning of chapter 3 is a **single argument**. The first part of
chapter 2—and I would argue everything in chapter 1 as well—lays out the
theological truths about Christ and the Gospel that form the foundation of the
argument. What comes **after** our passage, starting in verse 16, is the
application. The passage before us this morning, then—verses 6 through 15—is the
hinge upon which we transition from those critical theological truths into
specific application.

My strategy this morning is to respect that same development of the argument. So
unlike a typical sermon, I’m not going to get into a lot of specific application
this week—that will come in the weeks that follow. This morning is going to have
a lot more of a “classroom Sunday school” feel. This morning we’re the setup, so
to speak, taking a softball and tossing out that nice, slow, juicy, fat pitch,
and then over the next several weeks [other teachers] can crush that thing and
bring us home.

Let’s start by reading all of chapter 2 together.

# The Problem

Let’s be real clear about the problem that Paul is addressing. He doesn’t want
his readers to be duped by certain “fine-sounding arguments.” He describes it in
both general and specific terms:

| General                                 | Specific                                |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| “fine-sounding arguments” (v.4)         | “what you eat or drink” (v.16)          |
| “hollow and deceptive philosophy” (v.8) | “New Moon celebration” (v.16)           |
| “human tradition” (v.8)                 | “Sabbath day” (v.16)                    |
| “elemental spiritual forces” (v.8)      | “false humility” (v.18)                 |
| “rules” (v.20)                          | “Do not handle / taste / touch!” (v.21) |

There’s a false way of going about the Christian life that revolves around
rules, ritual, and tradition. Paul doesn’t want us to be suckered in by these
hollow philosophies. But we do get suckered in, don't we?

And here, I think, is how we often fall into this. Because we believed the
Gospel, we know that our sins have been forgiven. The penalty has been paid. And
we’re thankful in our hearts to God for that gift. So wouldn’t it be awesome if,
from the moment you believed, your life was actually free from sin? But that’s
not how it works at all, is it? As we actually live life, day after day, our
words and actions betray a continual struggle with our brokenness.

- We get angry and yell at our kids or spouse;
- We return again to an addiction like alcohol that we swore we’d never return
  to;
- We give in to lust and the temptation of pornography;
- We just find ourselves kind of apathetic and lazy about spending time with God
  in prayer and devotion—there’s no real sense of urgency or intimacy with God.

And to many of us, that continuing failure is really frustrating and
discouraging. And **right here**, I submit, is where we often go wrong. In the
midst of our frustration, we start to look around for that silver bullet that
will bring us up to “level 2” Christianity. And when you start seeking, there
will be no shortage of people lining up to sell you those secrets.

In Paul’s day, these things, as we just read, involved elements of ritualistic
Judaism and asceticism, probably spread by local teachers and gurus. In our day
with more global information, these typically take the form of movements:

- Rituals that promise the secret to God’s blessing .(Some of you remember the
  “Prayer of Jabez” craze from the dawn of this millennium.)
- Specific rules that regulate the “Christian” way to diet, educate our
  children, and so on.
- 30 days of this, and 12 weeks of that.

And here’s the thing: they **sound** good at the time. That’s why we get duped.
As verse 23 states, _“Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with
their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of
the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.”_ They
often work for a time, but tend not to last. Or often, they just swap out one
vice like laziness and replace it with another one like arrogance. My goal this
morning is the same as Paul: to present before us an appreciation of the glory
of Jesus Christ and the Gospel—and what that means for us—so that we find our
sufficiency in Him and are not taken in by the Next Great Thing that promises
way more than it can deliver.

# The Alternative: Union with Christ

The alternative is found right there in the first verse of our passage, _“So
then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in
him, rooted and built up in him…”_

When we talk about the Gospel, sometimes we come away with a limited view that
the Gospel is merely the message that gets us into the kingdom. We believe the
Gospel, the penalty for our sins is forgiven, and now we need to get busy with
our discipleship programs. That’s an incomplete understanding. The Gospel **is**
the proclamation that we have been set free from the **penalty** of our sins,
but it is **also** the proclamation that we have been set free from the
**power** of sin in our lives, and that makes a huge difference to how we go
about the rest of our lives here on earth.

> “Just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord [salvation], continue to live your
> lives in him [sanctification]…”

Let’s walk through the passage a bit…

In verse 9, _“In Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form…”_
That’s the same glorious truth we studied in the previous chapter. That Jesus
Christ is fully God, perfect in power and righteousness. But look where the
passage goes next with that truth in verse 10: _“and in Christ you have been
brought to fullness.”_ In most of our English Bibles the word “fullness” is used
in both verses. It’s not exactly the same Greek word, but they share the same
root and basic meaning. If you write in your Bibles, you might circle those two
words and draw a line connecting them. This is the “hinge” that I was talking
about earlier—in this section Paul is taking what is true of Christ and
explaining how our union with him makes certain realities true in our life as
well. Not in exactly the same way—we will never be divine—but in some way our
union with Christ in the Gospel brings us also to a place of fullness, of
completeness. Significantly, this completeness isn’t just in heaven in the
future—notice the tense of the verb—but now, in this life. That fullness is
going to be explained in the verses that follow.

We’re actually going to skip ahead and then come back to these verses 11 and 12.
Skip ahead to verse 13 and hear (again) the gospel message:

> “When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, God
> made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the
> charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he
> has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.”

Now I don’t want to rush through or skip over this, but it’s impossible to
improve on what Paul says here. This is the **good news**. We were dead in our
sins—condemned, powerless, but God made us alive with Christ. The penalty for
our sins has been cancelled, paid in full by death of Jesus on the cross.
**God** did this: not our good deeds, not our ritual, not our sincerity. Because
of **Christ’s** righteousness. We just believe.

If you’re here this morning, not as a believer (and so everything I’ve said so
far has sounded pretty irrelevant), but just because you’re curious about what
Christians believe, this is it. Honestly, that’s the only thing you need to hear
this morning. You have my permission to tune out everything else I say this
morning and read that over and over.

But for those of us who are believers, notice how then Paul moves on from the
**penalty** of our sins being forgiven to the **power** of sin being broken:

> “And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of
> them, triumphing over them by the cross.”

In verse 10 it was stated that Jesus is head over all powers and authorities,
and in verse 15 it states what he’s done with that rule: He’s disarmed them and
exposed them as powerless. **That’s** the attitude we’re supposed to have when
we think of our spiritual enemies: not just the demonic realm but our own flesh
and calls to temptation. In light of what Christ has done, **they no longer hold
power over us**.

But sometimes we don’t live that way, do we?

I’m going to do something I promised myself I would never do. I’m going to use a
super-hero analogy. (You can take away my “Reformed” card after the service.)
Nonetheless, I think it’s helpful.

In the Spider-Man mythology, ordinary guy Peter Parker gets bit by a radioactive
spider, which grants him superpowers. Now from the moment he is bit, he has been
changed, but there’s a period of time where he is still living as his old self.
Two things need to happen: one, there’s a knowledge component—he starts to
recognize what has happened (mostly through accidents); and two, there’s an
element of choice, to embrace that new identity—and that makes all the
difference. And “with great power comes great responsibility” and all that—I’m
not going to push the analogy.

So also with us. If you are a believer in Christ, this passage lays out before
you some really important truths about your identity in Christ. That’s the
knowledge component, which I pray we all have ears to hear this morning. But
there’s also an element of embracing those truths of who we are in Christ, of
finding our identity in Him.

# Union with Christ

Jumping back up to verse 11, Paul uses two metaphors, circumcision and baptism,
to help us understand our identity in Christ. Both of these are signs that God
gave to his people, and like all signs, the signs themselves aren't the point,
but they point toward a greater reality and truth.

The first sign, in verse 11, is circumcision. Circumcision is, literally, the
physical cutting off and removal of a part of our flesh. That’s as far as we’ll
go this morning—we’ll keep things PG-13. That sign points to the reality that if
you are in Christ, your old self (ruled by the flesh) has been removed. _“Your
whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ.”_
It’s cut off. It’s gone. It’s dead. It’s powerless. That’s part of our new
identity. Not just the **penalty** for sin forgiven, but the **power** of sin
over our lives is dead.

The second sign, baptism, communicates the same truth but takes it one step
further. “_…Having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also
raised with him through your faith in the working of God, who raised him from
the dead.”_

Now, we need to have a quick aside here. When we talk about baptism in this
church, our minds are naturally going to envision infant baptism done via the
sprinkling of water. That is, by far, the most common form of baptism to which
most of us are familiar. It’s a sign of the New Covenant promise, recognizing
that it is ultimately God who chooses and saves his people. However, the
Presbyterian Book of Order also recognizes and encourages baptism for adult
believers who were not baptized as an infant—that’s not just a Baptist thing. An
adult who has made a credible profession of faith is baptized as a sign of the
faith that he already claims as his own. That’s a less common occurrence for
this congregation—and often this happens out at Brady’s Run Lake so it’s not as
common an experience for many of us. It would have been a very common
experience, however, for the early church as the Gospel is spreading over the
Roman Empire and that first generation of adult believers is coming to faith.

In order to understand the point Paul is making here, you really need to picture
in your mind adult believer’s baptism by full immersion—think dunking under
Brady’s Run Lake (which represents our union with Christ in His death—we were
“buried with him” the text says) and then coming back out (representing our
union with Christ in His resurrection—we were “raised up with him”). It’s the
same reality as the analogy of circumcision. In Christ, our old enslaved-to-sin
self has died. But the image of baptism goes one step further. It’s not just
that the old self is gone (and we are left void), but we are “born again”—a new
self is put on, one that is alive in Christ, with the power of the Holy Spirit
to overcome. “If anyone is in Christ,” the Bible will say elsewhere, “the new
creation has come: the old is gone, the new is here!”

I want to reiterate the point one more time. In Christ, the penalty for our sins
has been forgiven. But it is so much more than that. Our old self, which was
enslaved to sin, which had no choice but to give into temptation, has been cut
off and buried with Christ. And we have been given a new self, which, by the
empowerment of the Holy Spirit, has the ability to say “No” to temptation and
sin.

This truth, then, forms the backbone of the application that follows. Follow
along with me on a few highlights:

> 2:20 - Since you died with Christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this
> world, why, as though you still belonged to the world, do you submit to its
> rules: “Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!”?
>
> 3:1 - Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things
> above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on
> things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden
> with Christ in God.
>
> 3:9 - Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with
> its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in
> knowledge in the image of its Creator.

# How this makes a difference

One thing I want to make clear as we close. Paul is clearly attacking legalism
and ritualism in this section. Yet, just as clearly, as you read through the New
Testament—or even the rest of this letter—there are obviously rules and
expectations that we are to obey as followers of Christ. So what’s the deal? And
that really needs to be teased out in a larger study, but I want to say here
that there is a world of difference between a silver-bullet mentality (based on
man-made rules, rituals, and traditions) vs. Gospel-motivated love and
discipline. So to take one example from earlier:

**When you are struggling with your anger...** That’s a gospel moment: _“Just as
you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him.”_ Confess
your sin, thank Jesus for His righteousness that paid the penalty for sinful
anger, and embrace the reality that the power of that sin is also broken. Your
old self has died—your struggle with anger doesn’t have to end in defeat. As you
pray for the Spirit’s help, He might lead you to seek counseling, or to have a
daily ritual of writing down things you are thankful for, etc.

At the end of the day, there should still be rules in your life that you follow,
discipline that helps you keep your spiritual priorities, etc. But those rules
and discipline are not the secrets to success—to reach “level 2” Christianity.
Rather, they are tools that the Holy Spirit is using, as part of your new self,
to transform you more and more into the image of Christ.

As I try to communicate it with words, the difference sounds very subtle, but I
honestly don’t think that it is. It’s just a matter of not getting the cart
before the horse.

As it so happens, we find ourselves in the period of Lent. Many fast or give up
certain things during Lent. Can you see how this passage speaks precisely to
that issue? One can fast in a superstitious or ritualistic way that believes the
act of fasting somehow taps you into spiritual blessings or makes you more
pleasing to God. And this passage would say that's bankrupt. One might also fast
as a Spirit-led discipline that gives you opportunity to reflect on the humility
and sacrifice of Christ. Same external act, different motivations.

The gospel, then, is not just the message that the penalty of our sins has been
taken away, it is also the good news that the power of sin has been broken in
our lives. We are united with Christ in his death and in his resurrection—which
means that our old self, enslaved to sin, is dead, and have the ability to walk
in newness of life.

And over the next several weeks we’re going to hear how Paul makes those
abstract truths practical and real in our lives.
