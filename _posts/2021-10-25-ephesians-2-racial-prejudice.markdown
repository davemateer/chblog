Racial reconciliation and social justice have been major topics of discussion in
the culture for several years. Churches and parachurch organizations have
correspondingly been addressing these topics more frequently. This is not a bad
thing; God’s Word certainly has a great deal to say about these things,
including our equality based on being created in the image of God, and the love
we are to have for the disenfranchised. Churches who are preaching the whole
counsel of God—being Biblically proportionate—will regularly encounter God’s
wisdom that speaks to issues of social justice.

One frequent line of argumentation, however, which derives from the latter half
of Ephesians 2, warrants a critical evaluation. Here, Paul talks about two
distinct people groups, the Jews and the Gentiles, and how—through Christ—these
two groups are now one. I’m concerned that this passage falls prey to a bit of
“buzzword exegesis” that misses the main point that is being made, which is
rooted in the full redemptive-historical storyline. The passage mentions these
conflicting groups obtaining “peace”, the abolition of “enmity”, and
“reconciliation”, and a culturally-relevant sermon practically writes itself:
“Throughout the Old Testament, and at the time of Jesus, the Jewish people were
antagonistic towards Gentiles. They saw themselves as the insiders and were
prejudiced against those on the outside, seeking to preserve their privilege.
But through Christ, God has broken down that social enmity so that the two
groups are now reconciled. And thus, by way of application, we need to follow
that same example in our modern society, seeking to put away division among us.”

Those points and application are not wholely untrue. They are just not what
**this passage** is saying in its context.

# What is the source of the enmity?

Paul rather clearly identifies the source of this “dividing wall” and “enmity”,
and it‘s not the people‘s prejudicial hatred toward one another that is in view.
The dividing wall that was broken down, the source of enmity that was abolished,
was “the Law of commandments contained in ordinances”:

> For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the
> barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is
> the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might
> make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile
> them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the
> enmity.

We rightly proclaim that it was always God’s intention to bring all of
humanity—all tribes, peoples, and languages—together as one body in Christ. This
is inherent, for example, in the promises given in the Garden of Eden, and in
the promises given to Abraham. But what we often fail to acknowledge when
discussing passages like Ephesians 2 is that while this unity was part of God’s
good and perfect plan, so also was the (temporary) Old Covenant era, in which
**God determined** to separate a particular people, the Jews, and mediate that
covenant through the Mosaic Law which—among other things—was designed to
maintain their distinctiveness. The covenant blessings given exclusively to
Israel were very real. This was **God’s doing**, not the work of a people trying
desperately to maintain their privilege.

God-fearing foreigners were welcome, but in order for a foreigner to receive the
covenant blessings under the Old Covenant, they were required to adopt the
Jewish Law as their own. Passages like the following are repeated throughout the
Law:

> “As for the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger
> who resides among you, a permanent statute throughout your generations; as you
> are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord. There is to be one law and one
> ordinance for you and for the stranger who resides with you.” (Numbers
> 15:15–16)

The scandal of the New Covenant was that, in opening up the way of salvation to
the Gentiles, the Law no longer applied. Gentiles no longer had to “become
Jewish” in order to be first-class citizens. The economy of the New Covenant is
completely different, and this was a difficult thing for faithful Jews to grasp.

Andrew Lincoln summarizes the argument of this passage well:

> That which was the distinguishing mark of Israel under the old order, the
> Torah, has been abolished. As the symbol of the particularity and
> exclusiveness of Israel’s election, and thereby the source of hostility and
> alienation between Jews and Gentiles, it was quite unable to produce peace,
> but with its removal through Christ’s death reconciliation was able to take
> place on a new basis. [^1]

Understood in context, this section of Ephesians is sort of a “mini version” of
the arguments made in much more detail in the book of Galatians explaining the
proper relation of the Mosaic Law to the promises fulfilled in Christ. Ignoring
this, and making this passage in Ephesians all about socioeconomic racial
reconciliation, inadvertently turns the God of the Old Testament into a
repentant racist who “got woke” at the time of Jesus, a point I am quite sure no
one is trying to make.[^2]

# Speaking of Galatians...

A similar argument is often made from Galatians 2, where Peter is rebuked by
Paul for refusing to eat with the Gentiles. Again, one popular explanation is
that Peter had trouble casting aside his previous prejudice against Gentiles and
needed to be reminded of the inclusiveness demanded by the morals of Christ.
Thus, one often hears, “racial reconciliation is a Gospel issue”.

Racial reconciliation is a vital issue, and one that Christians should care
deeply about, but—at the risk of sounding a bit cheeky—in the context of
Galatians, the Gospel issue is: **the Gospel**. As the immediate context (and
indeed, the entire letter) makes clear, the issue at stake is a failure to grasp
the newness of the New Covenant, and the (non-)role that the Mosaic Law has in
both justification and sanctification. The Law, which is based on “doing”
(Galatians 3:12), must not be confused with faith, or else we have lost the
Gospel. This is the root of the hypocrisy that Paul is opposing. Paul goes on to
argue one of the most shocking ramifications of the new economy:

> If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker. For
> through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. (Galatians
> 2:18–19)

This is a scandalous point Paul is making. Understood as God intended, the
Mosaic Law brings us to faith in Christ (“through the law I died to the law so
that I might live for God”). It is those who rebuild a life based on law—after
having come to Christ—who are the true lawbreakers according to Paul. (“If I
rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.”)

This was a very difficult thing to accept for the early church, and remains a
difficult thing for many today, which I suspect is one reason we grasp onto
alternate interpretations of passages like Galatians 2 and Ephesians 2.

# Does it matter?

Does it matter, though? As long as we arrive at conclusions that are valid and
truthful on their own terms, does it make a huge difference how we got there?
Could we not just call it “secondary application”? Or perhaps argue the value of
keeping the Bible relevant? I would argue that it does matter, for two reasons.

First, let us not miss the self-evident fact that if we overlook the original
meaning of the text, we have robbed our readers/listeners of being reminded of
exactly that original intent of the passage. In the case of passages like the
ones above, there are powerful points being made about the newness of the New
Covenant, the supremacy of Christ, and the inadequacy of law-based living.
Especially in Galatians, this leads directly to an understanding of what it
means to live by the Spirit. These profound truths have immense present-day
relevance as we are ever tempted to return to the errors that plagued the
Pharisees.

Second, it inhibits the development of Biblical discernment. We are bombarded
continually with messaging telling us **what** we should think, from sources
such as social media influencers and the most extreme voices of our political
parties.[^3] Without discernment, the influence war is won by those most skilled
in rhetoric and marketing savvy. In teaching God’s Word, we are ideally not just
another voice communicating **what** to think, but modeling **how** to think,
showing others how to go from the original meaning of Scripture to modern
application, so they can in turn interpret the Bible for themselves. I fear that
when we skim over the main storyline to focus immediately on present relevance,
we miss the opportunity to better prepare our readers/listeners to sniff out the
error that bombards them every day.

Put another way, we rightly object if someone misinterprets Scripture and
arrives at a false conclusion, for example citing 1 Timothy 2:5[^4] to prove
that Jesus is less than divine, or Titus 2:11[^5] to endorse universalism. But
why do we object? I would argue that ultimately we are not merely rejecting the
**conclusions** of these errors, but more significantly the hermeneutical
**process** that led to those errors in the first place. A foundational key of
the historical-grammatical approach to hermeneutics is that “a text cannot mean
what it never meant … the true meaning of the biblical text for us is what God
originally intended it to mean when it was first spoken."[^6] Understanding that
interpretive principal is far more valuable than only being able to refute a
specific theological error. It’s the old adage of, “If you give a man a fish,
you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a
lifetime.”

    It’s not as if there are no passages of Scripture that speak directly to
    issues of prejudice or social justice. To cite a single example, the central
    question of the parable of the Good Samaritan is “Who is my neighbor?”, and
    the teaching of Jesus clearly answers that in a way that leaves no place for
    tribalism or religious justification of indifference.
