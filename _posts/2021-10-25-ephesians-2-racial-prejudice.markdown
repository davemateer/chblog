Racial reconciliation and social justice have been major topics of discussion in
the culture for several years. Churches and parachurch organizations have
correspondingly been addressing these topics more frequently. This is not a bad
thing; God’s Word certainly has a great deal to say about these things, from our
equality based on being created in the image of God, the love we are to have for
the disenfranchised, and much more. Churches who are preaching the whole counsel
of God—being Biblically proportionate—will regularly encounter God’s wisdom that
speaks to issues of social justice.

One frequent line of argumentation, however, which derives from the latter half
of Ephesians 2, warrants a critical evaluation. Here, Paul talks about two
distinct people groups, the Jews and the Gentiles, and how—through Christ—these
two groups are now one. I’m concerned that this passage falls prey to a bit of
“buzzword exegesis” that ignores the redemptive-historical context. The passage
mentions these conflicting groups obtaining “peace”, the abolition of “enmity”,
and “reconciliation”, and a culturally-relevant sermon practically writes
itself: “Throughout the Old Testament, and at the time of Jesus, the Jewish
people were antagonistic towards Gentiles. They saw themselves as the insiders
and were prejudiced against those on the outside, seeking to preserve their
privilege. But through Christ, God has broken down that social enmity so that
the two groups are now reconciled. And thus, by way of application, we need to
follow that same example in our modern society, seeking to put away division
among us.”

Those points and application are not wholely untrue. They are just not what
**this passage** is saying in its context.

# What is the source of the enmity?

Paul rather clearly identifies the source of this “dividing wall” and “enmity”,
and it‘s not the people‘s prejudicial hatred toward one another that is in view.
The dividing wall that was broken down, the source of enmity that was abolished,
was “the Law of commandments contained in ordinances”:

> For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the
> barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is
> the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might
> make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile
> them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the
> enmity.

We rightly proclaim that it was always God’s intention to bring all of
humanity—all tribes, peoples, and languages—together as one body in Christ. This
is inherent, for example, in the promises given in the Garden of Eden, and in
the promises given to Abraham. But what we often fail to acknowledge when
discussing passages like Ephesians 2 is that while this unity was part of God’s
good and perfect plan, so also was the (temporary) Old Covenant era, in which
**God chose** to separate a particular people, the Jews, and mediate that
covenant through the Mosaic Law which—among other things—was designed to
maintain their distinctiveness. The covenant blessings given exclusively to
Israel were very real. This was God’s doing, not the work of a people trying
desperately to maintain their privilege.

God-fearing foreigners were welcome, but in order for a foreigner to receive the
covenant blessings under the Old Covenant, they were required to adopt the
Jewish Law as their own:

> “As for the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger
> who resides among you, a permanent statute throughout your generations; as you
> are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord. There is to be one law and one
> ordinance for you and for the stranger who resides with you.” (Numbers
> 15:15–16)

The scandal of the New Covenant is that, in opening up the way of salvation to
the Gentiles, the Law no longer applied. Gentiles no longer had to “become
Jewish” in order to be first-class citizens. The economy of the New Covenant is
completely different, and this was a difficult thing for faithful Jews to grasp.

Andrew Lincoln summarizes the argument of this passage well:

> That which was the distinguishing mark of Israel under the old order, the
> Torah, has been abolished. As the symbol of the particularity and
> exclusiveness of Israel’s election, and thereby the source of hostility and
> alienation between Jews and Gentiles, it was quite unable to produce peace,
> but with its removal through Christ’s death reconciliation was able to take
> place on a new basis. [^1]

Understood in context, this section of Ephesians is sort of a “mini” version of
the arguments made in much more detail in the book of Galatians relating to the
proper role of the Mosaic Law in the promises fulfilled in Christ. Ignoring
this, and making this passage in Ephesians all about socioeconomic racial
reconciliation, turns the God of the Old Testament into a repentant racist who
“got woke” at the time of Jesus.

# Speaking of Galatians...

A similar argument is often made from Galatians 2, where Peter is rebuked by
Paul for refusing to eat with the Gentiles. Again, a popular explanation is that
Peter had trouble casting aside his previous prejudice against Gentiles and
needed to be reminded of the inclusiveness demanded by the morals of Christ.
Thus, one often hears, “racial reconciliation is a Gospel issue”.

Racial reconciliation is a vital issue, and one that Christians should care
deeply about, but—at the risk of sounding a bit cheeky—in the context of
Galatians, **the Gospel** is the Gospel issue. As the immediate context (and
indeed, the entire letter) makes clear, the issue at stake is failing to grasp
the newness of the New Covenant, and the (non-)role that the Mosaic Law has in
justification. The Law, which is based on “doing” (Galatians 3:12), must not be
confused with faith, or else we have misunderstood the Gospel. This is the root
of the hypocrisy that Paul is opposing. Paul goes on to argue one of the most
shocking ramifications of the new economy:

> If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker. For
> through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. (Galatians
> 2:19–19)

Understood as God intended, the Mosaic Law brings us to faith in Christ
(“through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God”). It is those
who—having come to Christ—return to Law observance, who are the true
lawbreakers. (“If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a
lawbreaker.”)

This was a very difficult thing to accept for the early church, and remains a
difficult thing for many today, which I suspect is one reason we grasp onto
alternate interpretations of passages like Galatians 2 and Ephesians 2.

# Does it matter?

Does it matter, though? As long as we arrive at conclusions that are valid and
truthful on their own terms, does it make a huge difference how we get there?
Could we not just call it secondary application? Could it not be argued that
there is much value in keeping the Bible relevant, and that sticking
consistently to the context will make God’s Word dry and boring, and turn people
away?

I would argue that it does matter. We rightly object if someone misinterprets
Scripture and arrives at a false conclusion, such as citing 1 Timothy 2:5[^2] to
prove that Jesus is less than divine, or Titus 2:11[^3] to endorse universalism.
However, we must reject not only the **conclusions** of these errors, but also
the hermeneutical **process**.

In teaching God’s Word, we are not only communicating what to think, but also
modeling for others how to interpret the Bible for themselves. I fear that the
currently popular way of interpreting passages like the ones above emphasizes to
our listeners _what_ to think, with less concern for _how_ to think, and misses
the main point of the passages themselves.[^4] Consistently modelling a more
cautious approach is, I believe, a better way of equipping our listeners to
discern the voice of God in their own study of his word, and guard against being
“tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine.”

    It’s not as if there are no passages of Scripture that speak directly to
    issues of prejudice or social justice. To cite a single example, the central
    question of the parable of the Good Samaritan is “Who is my neighbor?”, and
    the teaching of Jesus clearly answers that in a way that leaves no place for
    tribalism or religious justification of indifference.
