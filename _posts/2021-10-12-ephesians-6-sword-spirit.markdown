Ephesians 6 is a very familiar passage to most Christians. Through a memorable
series of metaphors, Paul teaches believers of all ages how to successfully
stand against the powers of darkness arrayed against them.

This article argues for an interpretation of the final metaphor (the sword of
the Spirit) that differs from the way it is commonly understood. It will be
argued that this alternate interpretation better maintains the consistency of
the underlying metaphorical structure, permits the most natural
pronoun-antecedent agreement, maintains the flow of the argument, and reinforces
a doctrine that is generally underemphasized in many contemporary churches.

The metaphor of the sword has traditionally been understood as an exhortation to
the fervent study and application of the Holy Scripture. We might unambiguously
(albeit cumbersomely) translate the passage something like, “take the Spirit’s
sword; that sword represents the Scripture; the Scripture is the word of God.”
This article argues that the reality to which the metaphor of the sword points
is, in fact, the Spirit Himself, and that the Spirit (like the second member of
Trinity) is here identified as “the Word of God.”

# Argument 1: The Structure of the Metaphors

For each metaphor in the series in verses 14 through 17, there is:

1. a piece of armor that serves as the basis for the metaphor,
2. an action by which that piece of the armor is equipped, and
3. the reality to which the metaphor points, i.e. the concept/truth that we are
   to “put on” that we may stand against the devil’s schemes.

Four of the metaphors (breastplate, shield, helmet, and sword) use the same
grammatical structure:[^1]

| Verb (aorist)                | Noun (accusative)                   | Noun (genitive)                      |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| put on <br /> ἐνδυσάμενοι    | the breastplate <br /> τὸν θώρακα   | righteousness <br /> τῆς δικαιοσύνης |
| taking up <br /> ἀναλαβόντες | the shield <br /> τὸν θυρεὸν        | faith <br /> τῆς πίστεως             |
| take <br /> δέξασθε          | the helmet <br /> τὴν περικεφαλαίαν | salvation <br /> τοῦ σωτηρίου[^2]    |
| take <br /> δέξασθε          | the sword <br /> τὴν μάχαιραν       | the Spirit <br /> τοῦ πνεύματος      |

In the case of the breastplate, shield, and helmet, the genitive case is
understood as a genitive of apposition. That is, the substantive in the genitive
case identifies that to which the metaphorical noun refers. The breastplate
represents righteousness, the shield represents faith, and the helmet represents
salvation. As Christians, we are to “put on / take up” the objects of each
metaphor: righteousness, faith, and salvation. To be unambiguous, we would
translate these verses something like “Put on the breastplate; that is, put on
righteousness.”

Specifically, the genitive nouns are understood **not** to be possessive. It is
not “Righteousness’s breastplate”, i.e. “the breastplate which belongs to
righteousness”, nor “faith’s shield”, nor “salvation’s helmet”. Nonetheless, in
the final metaphor, where Paul commands us to “take … the sword of the Spirit”,
despite the identical grammatical structure to the previous metaphors, the usual
interpretation switches to a possessive genitive. Paul, it is argued, is talking
about “the Spirit‘s sword”, and the reality is the word of God, i.e. the Holy
Scripture.

If we understand this metaphor in the same way as the others, however, a
different interpretation emerges. The reality to which the metaphor of the sword
points is the Holy Spirit Himself. In our fight against the schemes of the
devil, we are to equip ourselves with God the Spirit Himself.

# Argument 2: The Antecedent of “Which is the Word of God”

The verse in question continues, “Take … the sword of the Spirit, which is the
word of God.” This extra clause (“which is the word of God”) is what makes the
traditional understanding so natural, attaching the pronoun “which” to “sword”
as its antecedent. Continuing our awkward but unambiguous translations, one
might say, “Take up the Spirit’s sword. This ‘sword’ is the word of God.”
Indeed, a similar clarifying clause is used in verse 16:

> “… taking up the <span style="color:purple">shield</span> (θυρεὸν,
> **masculine**) of <span style="color:red">faith</span> (πίστεως, **feminine**)
> with <span style="color:purple">which</span> (ᾧ, **masculine**) you will be
> able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.”

Note in the verse above that the gender of the pronoun “which” agrees with the
gender of the metaphorical piece of armor “shield”. In contrast, the gender of
the pronoun “which” in verse 17 agrees with “Spirit”, not “sword”:

> “… the <span style="color:red">sword</span> (μάχαιραν, **feminine**) of the
> <span style="color:green">Spirit</span> (πνεύματος, **neuter**),
> <span style="color:green">which</span> (ὅ, **neuter**) is the word of God.”

In the most natural interpretation, then, “the Word of God” is further
explaining who the Spirit is, and not referring back to the metaphorical sword
as the traditional interpretation understands.[^3] Simply changing “which” to
“who” effectively captures the difference in English:

> “And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, who is the
> word of God.”

The unity of our Triune God is thus reinforced. Just as Jesus, the incarnate
Word of God (John 1:1), revealed the Father to His disciples, so also the Holy
Spirit.[^4] The Scriptures elsewhere testify to the effectual teaching and
God’s-mind-revealing ministry of the Holy Spirit. A few of the many examples
include John 14:26, John 16:7, 1 John 2:27, and 1 Corinthians 2:10-15. These are
not isolated verses; this theme is extremely prominent throughout the New
Testament; indeed, it is one of the defining aspects of the New Covenant. To the
degree that we neglect this truth, we risk turning Kingdom living back into the
oldness (and deadness) of the letter instead of the newness of the Spirit.

# Argument 3: The Flow of the Passage

Finally, notice how our understanding provides a clean flow into verse 18.
Rather than introducing a separate thought, Paul is expounding on what it means
to “put on” the Spirit: “through all prayer and supplication praying at all
times in the Spirit.” It also connects the exhortations of the armor metaphor
with Paul’s earlier instructions about what it looks like to be filled with the
Spirit (5:18ff).

# Conclusion

The arguments above should not be misunderstood as denying the conclusions from
the traditional interpretation. Elsewhere believers are certainly commanded to
diligently study and apply the Scriptures, and the Scriptures are even connected
with a different sword metaphor in Hebrews 4:12. I would argue, however,
Scripture also reinforces the truth that the Holy Spirit is indispensible to New
Covenant believers in their fight against the evil one, and that He gloriously
reveals the will and character of the Father to those in whom He dwells. This is
not an either/or choice of truths. The conclusions from both the traditional
interpretation and the argument above can be supported elsewhere in Scripture,
and both should be embraced.

Nonetheless, the passage in question does have a single meaning. The arguments
presented above explain what inclines me to depart from the traditional
understanding.

[^1]:
    In the other two (“having girded your loins with truth”; “having shod your
    feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace”), the actual piece of
    armor is not explicit, being implied by the action. Some translations
    include the implied piece of armor (for example, NIV “belt”, NLT “shoes”)
    not present in the original. Since the grammatical structure of these two
    differs from the formula used in the sword metaphor, we ignore these in our
    analysis, although the general patterns described below would be consistent
    with them as well.

[^2]: Strictly speaking, an adjectival noun.
[^3]:
    It is true that pronouns in Koine Greek do not absolutely have to agree with
    their antecedent. There are several exceptions within the book of Ephesians.
    However, exceptions are, by definition, exceptional. The natural agreement
    should be preferred unless exceptional situations force the alternative. I
    would argue that no such exception is necessary in this verse.

[^4]:
    The word used in Ephesians 6:17 is _rhema_, not the _logos_ of John 1:1.
    However, I agree with those exegetes who see no need to introduce an
    absolute disjunction between these terms; they have considerable semantic
    overlap, and can be used synonymously. See, for example, 1 Peter 1:23 and
    1:25.
