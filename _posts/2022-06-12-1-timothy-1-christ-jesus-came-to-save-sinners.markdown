  The passage today is autobiographical, but Paul’s a little less flattering

# Introduction

> I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered
> me trustworthy, appointing me to his service. Even though I was once a
> blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I
> acted in ignorance and unbelief. The grace of our Lord was poured out on me
> abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
>
> Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came
> into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. But for that very
> reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus
> might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe
> in him and receive eternal life. Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible,
> the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.

So, a little icebreaker to start out here. (This is the kind of thing you can do
in a small church.) I’m going to give the title of an autobiography, and you
tell me who the author is. Some of these might be known because they are famous,
some because the title gives it away, some I just thought were funny.

- The Diary of a Young Girl (Anne Frank)
- Don't Hassel the Hoff (David Hasselhoff)
- Long Walk to Freedom (Nelson Mandela)
- Becoming (Michelle Obama)
- I Can’t Wait Until Tomorrow, Cause I Get Better Looking Every Day (Joe Namath)

The passage today is autobiographical, but Paul’s a little less flattering about
himself than Mr. Namath. He calls himself “the worst of sinners” (which might
have been the title of his autobiography), as well as “a blasphemer and a
persecutor and a violent man”.

# Paul the blasphemer

And it needs to be said that this description isn’t an exaggeration. As you read
through the book of Acts, you get glimpses here and there of who Paul was. You
recall that when Stephen was stoned (in Acts 7), the witness laid their coats at
the feet of Paul as they stoned Stephen to death, and Paul heartily approved of
the crowd’s actions. We’re told that, following that event, Paul “began to
destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off both men and women
and put them in prison.”

This misplaced zeal defined Paul’s life. Later in Acts, as Paul looks back on
that period of life, he would say this (Acts 22):

> I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and
> women and throwing them into prison… (Acts 22:4)

“To their death”, Paul says. He persecuted Christians to their death if
necessary.

So when Paul describes himself as a blasphemer, persecutor, and violent man,
that’s no exaggeration.

# “Well-intentioned” blasphemy?

Here’s what struck me as I was studying this passage. When I hear the word
“blasphemy”, I tend to think of an irreligious blasphemy, or maybe a better way
of saying it is blasphemy that is deliberately rebelling against God.

- So, you know, when I was in my teens, some of the music I listened to was from
  your stereotypical heavy-metal bands, where, you know, part of the shtick
  (part of the marketing) is the shock-factor of cursing the name of God. That’s
  blasphemy.

- Or maybe the academic in his ivory tower, who is too smart for God, and out of
  that position of arrogance ridicules the God of the Bible as a myth or a
  monster.

- Or, you know, stories of deconversion, which are trendy right now, where
  high-profile people who once claimed to believe in Christ, become disappointed
  / disenfranchised in some way and reject God, turning their energies into
  efforts that mock God.

Those would all certainly qualify as blasphemy, but in all those cases the
person is consciously choosing sides against God. That really isn’t the form it
took in Paul’s life. His was a very (can we call it this?) well-intentioned
blasphemy. At the time, Paul certainly wouldn’t have categorized his behavior as
blasphemy. From what we just saw of Paul’s life, he truly believed that his
intense zeal was in the service of God.

What we should see then is that zeal and sincerity are not enough. One can be
seriously sincere, and also seriously deluded. And those delusions can have
devastating consequences. Paul was committed to a false ideology, and his false
beliefs are what fueled his persecution and violence against those who disagreed
with him, all the while thinking that he is faithfully serving God.

And that, unfortunately, is a reality worth pondering for a minute because if
we’re honest that strikes really close to home in our current culture, and in
the church. We see this most clearly today, I would submit, where political
ideologies get brought into the church. Where instead of the Bible being the
authority, deriving our thinking from it, and letting that worldview stand in
judgement of ideologies, the ideologies are treated as primary and then we find
ways to sprinkle Bible verses on top to justify those ideologies. And this is on
both sides. Where legitimate Christian terms and concepts like equality and
justice (if you are on the one side), or responsibility and freedom (for the
other side)—things we can and should be talking about—are hijacked to support
ideologies that result … in what? Not in “love from a pure heart and sincere
faith”, like verse 5 talked about, but rather the same types of “persecution and
violence” against others that Paul’s path led him down.

One can be seriously zealous and sincere about one’s beliefs, and also be
seriously wrong. That was Paul’s experience.

# Christ’s mercy shown to us

But something changes in Paul’s life to rescue him from false ideology. And it’s
the same thing that needs to happen today—an encounter with the living Savior.
Back in 1 Timothy 1, in verse 13 Paul notes that he “was shown mercy”. In fact,
look down at that whole first paragraph, from verses 12 to 14, and take note of
who is contributing what in Paul’s calculus. Here’s what Paul is contributing:

- “I was once a blasphemer”
- “I was once a persecutor”
- “I was once a violent man”
- “I acted in ignorance”
- “I acted in unbelief”

That’s Paul’s contribution, which if you are keeping score at home, adds up to
zero. And here is God’s side of the equation:

- “Christ Jesus gave me strength”
- “Christ Jesus considered me trustworthy”
- “Christ Jesus appointed me to his service”
- “I was shown mercy”
- “The Lord’s grace was poured out on me abundantly”
- “The Lord’s faith was poured out on me”
- “The Lord’s love was poured out on me”

It’s not a balanced equation at all. Paul’s contribution to salvation, just like
ours, adds up to nothing. Really, less than nothing. We’re bringing sin and
brokenness. It is **despite** who we are, that God has mercy through Christ
Jesus.

Which leads to the trustworthy statement in verse 15, which is the gospel, and
this is the main point. “Here is a trustworthy statement” comes up a few times
in this letter and elsewhere in the New Testament, and we can basically
translate that as “Here’s the main point; don’t miss this.” What Paul states
here is the Gospel, the “good news”. Here’s the news: “Christ Jesus came into
the world to save sinners.” That’s good news because we all qualify! We’re all
sinners!

We don’t come to Christ with the attitude that God’s really lucky to have us on
His team. Boy, I am such a friendly person; God must have chosen me because He
knows how good I’ll be at evangelism. Or boy, God must have chosen me because
I’m so intelligent. Or eloquent. Or talented. Or insert-whatever-here. No, if
you are a Christian here today, you made the team because “Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners.” Congratulations!

# Of whom I am the worst…

And then Paul adds this comment, “of whom I am the worst.” Now that phrase
generates a lot of discussion. Some of the questions people debate about:

- Is Paul talking about being the worst of sinners because of his past (his
  blasphemy, persecution, and violence that he talked about in the immediate
  context)? Or—notice the present tense—is he referring to his present life,
  even more aware of his sinfulness now that he is in Christ?

- Does Paul intend for us to understand “the worst of sinners” as describing
  himself, or are we meant to read this as applying to ourselves as well? That
  is, should every Christian see him or herself also as the worst of sinners?

Those are interesting questions, and those would be good discussion fodder while
we are eating or some other time if you are interested. I would just say here
that those options are not necessarily as mutually exclusive as they might seem
at first. That being said, in context I think Paul’s meaning is pretty clear.
Continue reading in verse 16: “But for that very reason I was shown mercy so
that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense
patience as an **example** for those who would believe in him and receive
eternal life.”

“If the mercy of Jesus Christ is great enough to save me,” Paul is saying, “and
I used to **MURDER HIS FOLLOWERS**!—then certainly that should be sufficient to
demonstrate that no one is outside of the mercy of God.” It doesn’t depend on
you.

- Your sexual brokenness doesn’t disqualify you. “Christ Jesus came into the
  world to save sinners.”
- Your pride and pattern of lying to others to appear better than you are
  doesn’t disqualify you. “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners”
- Your addiction doesn’t disqualify you. “Christ Jesus came into the world to
  save sinners.”
- Your greed and self-absorption doesn’t disqualify you. “Christ Jesus came into
  the world to save sinners.”

# Christ’s mercy available to “them”

And … sin doesn’t disqualify “THEM”, whoever we label as “THEM”.

I think that’s one of the reasons that this passage exists in the context in
which we find it. Note that what immediately precedes our passage is a list that
Paul is contrasting with the righteous: “the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and
irreligious, those who kill their fathers or mothers, murderers, the sexually
immoral, those practicing homosexuality, slave traders and liars and perjurers.”

Reading a list like that, isn’t it our instinct to assume those people are
outside of the realm of possibility of receiving God’s grace?

But that’s Paul whole point … they are NOT disqualified from the Gospel. He was
one of them! He was ungodly, sinful, unholy, a murderer. If God’s mercy can be
shown to Paul, then certainly it can be extended to them as well.

In the same way that your sins (my sins) don’t disqualify us, so also the sins
of others don’t disqualify them.

- Your boss who is a jerk and climbs the corporate ladder by exploiting workers
  and customers? “Christ Jesus came to save sinners”
- Your neighbor who marches in support of abortion rights? “Christ Jesus came to
  save sinners”

To be clear, there is a distinction being made here, an “us vs. them”; verse 9
explicitly makes that connection. “The law is made not for the righteous but for
lawbreakers”. NOT this, BUT that. But the distinction isn’t between “us” (whom
God chose because of how awesome we are) and “them” (who are too sinful to be
saved) but between the righteous (those sinners who have received God’s mercy)
and the unrighteous (those sinners who have not YET received God’s mercy).

Or to put this another way, we can ask: “Is the gospel inclusive?” Wow, that’s a
loaded term in today’s culture, huh? And I would say that it depends on how you
define “inclusive”. Let’s say this circle is the set bounding Christianity and
those outside of Christianity. The world’s definition of inclusivity would say
that we need to stretch the boundaries of the circle. “Oh, you’re ok where you
are, no need to change, we’ll just stretch to include you.” “Oh, it doesn’t
matter what you believe about that, we’ll include you as well.” By that
definition, the gospel is decidedly NOT inclusive. But if by inclusive, we mean
that the boundary of this set is completely permeable, inviting anyone in
regardless of what’s in their past, then yes, the gospel is infinitely
inclusive.

There are many testimonies about murderers on death row who have a religious
experience while awaiting execution and profess Christ as Savior. It’s easy to
be cynical, and—to be sure—some of those are, I’m sure, insincere attempts to
win favor. But by all accounts, many of those are genuine, and those persons
will be, like the thief on the cross, in paradise, forgiven of their sins. Is
that fair? Absolutely not. But none of this is fair. If we all got what was
fair, we’d all be condemned, without hope. No, rather, Christ Jesus came into
the world to save sinners.

# Gospel centrality while correcting error

That’s the first reason this passage is here, in this context: the gospel must
remain central to keep us humble, reminding us that we are all on equal footing
in terms of our dependence upon God’s grace.

I would submit that there’s a second reason this passage is here in its context,
and to see that, we need to look at an even larger context, that of the entire
chapter and letter.

There’s something very curious about this passage. Look down at your Bibles and
take note of the flow of this chapter. In verses 3 and 5, Paul is giving Timothy
a command: “To instruct certain people not to teach strange doctrines … the goal
of this command is love…” The purpose of this letter, Paul says, is to help
Timothy correct error that is in the church. Hang on to that piece of
information, we’ll come back to that in about two minutes.

Paul then begins to explain the difference between correct doctrine and what
characterizes false doctrine through verse 11. Now, pretend that verses 12
through 17 aren’t there at all, and skip down to verse 18. “This command I
entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously
made concerning you, that by them you fight the good fight.” What command? The
command from verses 3 and 5. Paul hasn’t changed subjects. In a way, verses
12-17 almost break up the letter, like they don’t really belong there.

Some conclude by this that Paul kinda lost his train of thought, you know, he
starts talking about one thing then gets distracted and starts rambling on about
himself. And then he’s like, “Oh sorry, what was I talking about? Oh yeah: this
command, I entrust to you Timothy…” But if we believe in the divine inspiration
of Scripture, we need to reject lazy explanations like that. Rather, we ask the
question: how does this passage—about the centrality of the Gospel—inform the
larger command of correcting error in the church?

There are two ways we can go astray when addressing sin and false doctrine in
the church, and the gospel corrects for them both. The first mistake we can make
is that we come at it with an attitude of arrogance and superiority. That’s sort
of what we just talked about. The gospel reminds us that we’re all equality
dependent upon God’s mercy and illumination, so the goal becomes restoration
rather than “winning the argument” or “putting someone in their place”.

The second mistake we can make is that we don’t address sin and false doctrine
at all, because we falsely believe that any form of rebuke, correction, or
judgment, is in **conflict** with the gospel and Christ’s command to love. But
quite transparently, if we take these verses seriously, Paul sees these as
complementary, not conflicting. He says in verse 5 that “the goal of this
command is love,” our passage today glories in the gospel, and then Paul
proceeds throughout the letter to correct false teaching, sometimes in language
that we might consider harsh.

Here’s how Paul describes these persons:

- In chapter 1, they are devoted to myths, have turned to meaningless talk,
  don’t know what they are talking about, and have suffered shipwreck with
  regard to the faith.
- In chapter 4, they are hypocritical liars, their consciences have been seared.
- In the case of someone not caring for their relatives in chapter 5, they have
  denied the faith and are worse than an unbeliever.
- In chapter 6, they are conceited and understand nothing.

So, either Paul is being a complete hypocrite … **or** our definition of love is
influenced more by the priorities and agenda of an unbelieving culture than
faithfulness to God’s word.

Rather than seeing this passage as a digression, or—God help us—as a conflicting
message, we should see Paul’s glory in the Gospel as a necessary foundation
**while** we are correcting false teaching. Both/and, not either/or.

# Doxology

Paul concludes this passage in verse 17 with a doxology, and we’ll end with that
as well. “Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor
and glory for ever and ever. Amen.” That’s the appropriate response of every
Christian when we reflect on what God has done for us in the person and work of
Christ Jesus. We give him all the honor and glory. And again, to reinforce the
same point: **This** is the God who showed us mercy: the king, the eternal one,
the invisible one, the only God. God doesn’t need you or me. God doesn’t need
our church. But he chooses to show mercy to us, that we might be his instruments
to proclaim to others that “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.”
