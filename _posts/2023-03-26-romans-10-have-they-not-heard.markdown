  We’ve probably all heard at one point—or said ourselves—the saying, “God hates
  sin, but loves the sinner.” Is that a true or false statement?

# Introduction

The passage is Romans 10:14–21, but we’re going to start in verse 12:

> For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of
> all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, “Everyone who calls on the
> name of the Lord will be saved.”
>
> How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can
> they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear
> without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are
> sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good
> news!”
>
> But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who
> has believed our message?” Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message,
> and the message is heard through the word about Christ. But I ask: Did they
> not hear? Of course they did:
>
> “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the
> world.”
>
> Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says,
>
> “I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry
> by a nation that has no understanding.”
>
> And Isaiah boldly says,
>
> “I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did
> not ask for me.”
>
> But concerning Israel he says,
>
> “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.”

Just a super quick orientation to the context. Note that in verse 1 the subject
is the nation of Israel (“Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to
God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.”) and then also at the end of
the chapter in verse 21 (“But concerning Israel he says, “All day long I have
held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.”) So, quite obviously,
the original meaning of verses 14–21 must be grounded in that same context. In
fact, we’re smack in the middle of three chapters where Paul is pouring out his
anguish for the Jews—his own people—due to their rejection of the gospel, what
God’s purpose is even in this rejection, and their future. This is one of those
places where going through this letter little-by-little, week-by-week can let us
down just a bit. Chapters 9 through 11 are one single argument, originally
intended to be heard in one listening.

So I just want to throw that out there to anchor our understanding. Because if
you’ve been around church circles for a bit, it’s likely that you’ve heard
verses 14 and 15 used in the context of foreign missions. And there’s validity
in that, and we’re eventually going to get there, but I want to get there
through the lens of the original meaning. I guess that’s our super lame outline
for this morning: (1) what the passage originally meant for the nation of Israel
and (2) what it means for us.

# Did Israel hear? Yes.

Starting in verse 14 Paul presents a series of rhetorical questions that reveal
the necessary steps—at a human level (chapter 9 focused on the sovereignty of
God; chapter 10 is the human angle)—for someone to come to salvation.

- The end goal is for someone to call on the name of the Lord (v.13)
- In order to call on the name of the Lord, they have to believe (v.14)
- In order to believe, they have to have heard about the Lord (v.14)
- In order to hear about the Lord, someone has to proclaim / preach God’s
  message (v.14)
- In order for someone to proclaim God’s message, that person has to be sent
  (v.15)

As verse 17 states it, a little more succinctly, “Faith comes from hearing the
message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.”

Now Paul gives these to us in reverse chronological order, from the end result
working backwards to the causes. Maybe it’s just me, but I think better in terms
of forward sequence. So if we invert the direction of this steps, we have:

> Preacher is sent → Preacher proclaims the message → Message is heard → People
> believe → People call on the name of the Lord

So, keeping the original context in mind, you might ask, “Where did this
sequence break down for the nation of Israel?”

And I’m glad you asked that question, because that’s what Paul answers next. In
verse 18, “But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did!” And then Paul does
something very interesting in quoting the Old Testament, specifically Psalm
19:4:

> “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the
> world.”

Who is “they?” The quotation says that “**Their** voice has gone out into all
the earth, **their** words to the ends of the world.” In the original context of
Psalm 19, “they” are the heavens and the skies that proclaim the glory of God.
But look at what Paul did here, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This
happens over and over and over again in how the New Testament uses the Old
Testament; Paul is applying a truth from the Old Testament in its most glorious
fulfillment in Christ. In this context, quite obviously “they”—the ones who have
gone out, i.e. were sent, and whose voice has been heard—are the preachers of
the gospel.

But isn’t this a bit overstated? How can Paul claim that “their voice has gone
out into **all the earth**, their words to the **ends of the world**?” Even
today, 2,000 years later, there are remote groups who have yet to hear the
gospel.

Again, we have to remember the context. Paul is concerned here with the nation
of Israel. And from that perspective—and I need you to hear this point clearly,
because if you don’t, something I’m going to say later is going to sound really
offensive…. From the perspective of Israel, they heard the gospel; they are an
evangelized people. That does **not** mean that every single Israelite
individual heard the gospel, and certainly not that every Jew believed the
gospel. But considered as a people group, they were saturated with the good
news. Missionaries had gone forth. There were churches established in their
regions. If a Jew wanted to know the gospel, it was readily accessible.

So where did the process break down for Israel?

- Were preachers sent, and did they proclaim the message? Yep, their voice has
  gone out into all the earth.

- Was the message heard? Yep, verse 18 explicitly says that they did.

- So what’s the problem? In contrast with the Gentiles—this is verses 19 through
  21—Israel was a disobedient and obstinate people. The problem was unbelief.

Specifically, going back to verse 2 and what follows, they held—zealously
held—to a system, a worldview, that righteousness is based on law. And that is
fundamentally incompatible with the righteousness of God, a righteousness that
is by faith.

# Did America hear? Yes.

Now everything we’ve talked about thus far is the original context. But let’s
swing now to our context. Because most of what we’ve talked about is kinda
academic, right? I mean, our present context is not one where we are trying to
figure out Jew/Gentile relationships. But there are principles we can apply.

If we look back at the sequence of steps that Paul laid out—the steps, humanly
speaking, that need to occur for someone to come to a saving knowledge of
Christ—where is our culture at? Where did we get stuck?

And here’s where I really hope you were tuned into Paul’s argument earlier in
verse 18, otherwise this is going to be really offensive. I would submit to you
that, _in the same way_ that Paul could say about the nation of Israel that they
heard, so also for us. America has heard the good news. Beaver County has heard
the good news. We are an evangelized people.

That does **not** mean that every single person has heard the gospel, any more
than Paul’s words meant that every single Jew had heard the gospel when he wrote
those words. Nor does it mean that we should stop reaching out, stop witnessing,
stop serving; again, Paul can say what he says here and yet still during this
time there is fervent outreach to the Jews.

But in applying this text to our own culture, it does mean that I think we need
to at least consider a few things.

# Incompatible worldviews

One, that the problem isn’t necessarily access to the gospel, strictly speaking.
Israel had heard (verse 18), but they were a disobedient and obstinate people
(verse 21). There may be worldviews in place that are fundamentally incompatible
with the righteousness that is by faith, and just like the authors of the New
Testament did, we need to be aware of those worldviews, drawn them out, and
dismantle them.

Just as Israel had a worldview that was incompatible with the gospel (that
righteousness is by law), what are some of the dominant worldviews in our
culture that are fundamentally incompatible with the gospel, and cause unbelief?
Here’s a short list I came up with; I’m sure you could add others.

## 1. Righteousness based on sincerity

This is a review from last week. It is rather common to believe that it doesn’t
matter too much the content of your belief, as long as you are faithful to your
convictions and sincere. So, you know … Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, some form
of live-in-harmony-with-naturism, activism, etc. As long as you are sincere, all
those are valid paths.

Maybe ... but not if the Bible is true. That’s the point of verse 2. Israel was
zealous—they were sincere—but they were also sincerely and zealously wrong.
Sincerity isn’t enough. Jesus said, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No
one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6)

## 2. Righteousness based on the curve

This is maybe a softened version of Israel’s righteousness by law. There’s not
necessarily an exact external law, like the law of Moses, but a general sense
that, “Hey, everyone knows what’s good and bad, and I must be ok because I’m not
as bad as that guy.” No one may say it this way, but it’s almost like we have a
thermostat, constantly measuring the spiritual temperature of others, and making
sure we're above average.

But again, not according to God’s righteousness by faith. What did we see in
chapter 3? “There is no one righteous, not even one.” There’s no curve. We all
failed. We must have a different source of righteousness, outside of us,
credited undeservingly to us. And that’s what Jesus provides.

## 3. Righteousness based on vengeance

This is the weaponized version of the previous one, popular on social media. Not
only am I not as bad as that guy, but it’s necessary for me to expose that
person, to inflict pain on that other person, to signal my virtue.

What does God’s word say about that? Well, let’s be real … much of the time
what’s going on in social media is calling good evil and evil good, so that’s a
non-starter. But even in those cases where real sin is being called out, is that
righteousness going to save anyone? No, Romans 2 reminds us, “You, therefore,
have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you
judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the
same things.” Everyone, again, needs a righteousness outside of themselves.

## 4. Righteousness based on God’s niceness

Finally, here is the idea that, yeah, I’m not perfect, nobody is, but I don’t
believe that God would punish anyone. He’s too nice. He’s all about forgiveness,
right? A loving God will forgive everyone in the end.

But this focuses on one attribute of God at the expense of others, without
considering how they all work together. Exodus 34, “The Lord, the compassionate
and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining
love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin.” So far, so
good, right? Put that on a coffee mug. But the description of God continues,
“Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their
children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.” Not
making the coffee mug. God is love **and** holy and cannot just overlook sin.
But He has done something about it in Jesus, and thus righteousness is by faith,
by trusting in that sacrifice of Christ.

Again, those are just a few of the worldviews to which people in our culture are
committed, which can prevent them from being able to believe the gospel. And of
course, many others could be described. That’s the first application.

# Foreign missions

Second, we need to consider the possibility that God is doing some pretty
awesome things in other places that we would be wise to pay attention to. This
is starting to get into the argument of chapter 11, but Paul alludes to it here
in verses 19-20. God’s dramatic and miraculous work among the Gentiles was
intended—in part—to make the nation of Israel jealous and provoke them to
repent. And if the accounts are to be believed, and I think they should be, God
is doing some really amazing stuff today in places like China, South America,
and Africa.

There’s a reason that verses 14 and 15 are often used in the context of foreign
missions. Although Paul’s point in his original context was to demonstrate that
these things, in fact, had already happened among the Jews, it nonetheless
remain true that these are necessary steps. And not every group is in the same
place.

There are people groups today to whom no one has been sent with the gospel
message. There are people groups where missionaries have been sent, but the good
news not yet proclaimed because they are still learning the language and culture
so that they can communicate effectively. There are people groups where there is
a small presence of the gospel, but it hasn’t yet been heard across the group as
a whole because the hard work of carrying that message to other villages,
establishing churches, etc. is underway.

So some brief statistics. These are from the site peoplegroups.org. I mention
that only because there is no universal agreement on how one defines a distinct
“people group,” but their definitions seem reasonable and in any case show the
trends. They define a people group as “An ethno-linguistic group with a common
self-identity that is shared by the various members. For strategic purposes it
is the largest group within which the gospel can spread without encountering
barriers of understanding or acceptance.”

That’s a **pretty significant** distinction. By that definition, for example,
the vast, vast, vast majority of America is a **single** people group. A
separate people group might be, for example, the deaf community, where there is
a significant communication barrier that must be (and has been) overcome so that
people can understand one another. Or perhaps ethnic communities in larger
cities who have maintained their original language and customs. Those might be
distinct people groups. But we’re **not** talking Republican vs. Democrat here,
or Black vs White, or Rich vs. Poor, or Gen X vs. Gen Z. The barriers need to be
larger than that to constitute a distinct people group.

By that definition, here’s their estimate of the current progress of the gospel
globally.

- Reached: 4,810 groups (40%); 3.2 billion persons
- Unreached (engaged): 4,073 groups (34%); 4.5 billion persons
- Unreached (unengaged): 3,147 groups (26%); 278 million persons

That’s another point of application here. I’m sure many of us already are, but
if you aren’t involved in some way partnering with what God’s doing in some of
these other parts of the world, I’d recommend looking into it. God’s doing an
awesome thing, fulfilling his purposes which will culminate in what we read
about in Revelation, “After this I looked, and there before me was a great
multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and
language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb.” (Revelation 7:9) God
invites us out of our abundance to be a part of that. Missionaries need our
support, both in terms of prayer and emotional support, as well as financial
support. I’d be happy to connect you with some workers out on the field if you
are interested.

# Gratitude

And one final point of application, I think, is gratitude. If you are here today
knowing Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, recognize that these steps had to
happen. Someone was sent—a parent, a Sunday school teacher, a pastor, a
friend—and God allowed you to hear and believe. Here’s we can meld together the
truths from chapters 9 and 10. This section has focused on the human elements,
if you will. But underneath all of that we recognize that it is God’s sovereign
will being worked out.
