Well good morning, and Merry Christmas! I’d ask you to open your Bibles and turn
to the gospel of John, chapter 3. This will be a familiar passage to many of
you, especially verse 16, which is certainly one of the most well-known passages
in the Bible. We’re going to read verses 1 through 17, and then I’d encourage
you to keep your Bibles open to the passage and refer to the text as we work our
way through it.

> Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish
> ruling council. He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are
> a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are
> doing if God were not with him.”
>
> Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless
> they are born again.”
>
> “How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they
> cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”
>
> Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God
> unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but
> the Spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You
> must be born again.’ The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but
> you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone
> born of the Spirit.”
>
> “How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.
>
> “You are Israel’s teacher,” said Jesus, “and do you not understand these things?
> Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have
> seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. I have spoken to you of
> earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of

This passage centers around Jesus’ statement that “You must be born again.” Here
are the two questions I would like us to consider this morning:

First, what does that even mean? Even if you are not incredibly familiar with
Christianity, the phrase “born again” is probably familiar. If you **have** been around churches
for a while, it may be **too** familiar. Jesus says, “You must be born again,” and
what we hear is, “You must become a Christian.” Which, at the end of the day, is
true, but I want us to take a closer look this morning: Why does Jesus use **this**
metaphor about a new birth? What’s he getting at, exactly?

The second question to consider is “Why is this so confusing to Nicodemus?” As
you heard in the flow of the passage, there’s this back and forth between Jesus
and Nicodemus which reaches a head in verse 10 where Jesus rebukes Nicodemus for
his failure to understand. What wrong assumptions might Nicodemus have had that
prevented him from properly understanding, and what can we learn from that so we
don’t fall into similar errors?

With that outline in mind, let’s start working through the text.

# Nicodemus

The dialogue takes place between Jesus and Nicodemus. Here’s what we’re told
about Nicodemus:

- He is, according to verse 1, a Pharisee. The Pharisees were the religious
  elite of the nation of Israel. So Nicodemus is educated, he’s intelligent,
  he’s motivated, and he’s connected to the right people.

- Not only that, but in verse 10, we’re told something interesting. Jesus
  addresses him as “Israel’s teacher”. The original language suggests that this
  was a title. He’s “**the** teacher of Israel”. A parallel today might be to say
  that Nicodemus was the most tenured professor in the seminary, or the senior
  elder of the Presbytery. He’s in a position recognized for his education and
  (at least assumed) expertise in the Bible.

Although Nicodemus is a scholar of the Old Testament, his understanding is a bit
off, as the dialogue between he and Jesus makes clear.

We don’t really know why Nicodemus sought an audience with Jesus. Perhaps he was
expecting affirmation—for Jesus to thank him for his devotion. Perhaps he was
spying on behalf of the counsel of the Pharisees. Perhaps he was honestly
seeking Jesus’ instruction. We don’t know, because if you notice, Nicodemus doesn‘t
really get a chance to set the direction of the conversation.

<!-- (2 minutes; 7.5 minutes total) -->

Jesus, knowing what’s in the heart of all men—including Nicodemus—cuts right to
the chase and tells Nicodemus precisely what he needs to hear to have his
worldview challenged. The Pharisees placed a huge amount of emphasis on
obedience to the Law of the Old Covenant: the Ten Commandments and the rules
about sacrifices and tithing and Sabbath observance and other religious
festivals. Jesus counters, _“Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of
God unless they are born again.”_

The assumption that the path to a right relationship with God depends on how
well one measures up to some standard is very common. Whether it is the Mosaic
Law of the Pharisees, the Five Pillars of Islam, the idea of karma in Hinduism,
the system of ethics and meditation of Buddhism, or just the generic moralism of
secular America, it is a very common assumption that one’s outcome at the end of
one’s life is determined by how well one measures up. If I just do enough of the
right things (whatever those are), that will make up for all of the wrong things
in my past.

So, picture a timeline. I’m at some point along that timeline and can look back
and realize I’ve made a mess of things. If I just measure up to some standard,
from here on out, then I’ll be good-to-go in the end.

But Jesus says, “No, it doesn’t work that way. You can’t get from where you are
now to where you need to be to be right with God. You need to start all over at
the beginning. You need to be born again.”

Before moving to Beaver, our family lived in Florida for about four years. The
building in which we lived was originally built in 1925 as a hotel. Quite a
luxurious hotel (by the standards of 1925). Then during World War II it was used
to house naval pilots. In the 60’s it was purchased by a foundation and
converted into a private school. Finally, in 1976 it was purchased by a mission
organization and converted to apartments and its headquarters. So, the ballroom
was converted into a chapel, interior walls rearranged to convert individual
hotel rooms into apartments that could house families, etc. Now all of these changes
were **renovations**, improvements to the original structure to get from purpose A
to purpose B.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/ntm_apartments.jpg" caption="Mayfair Hotel" %}

This idea of **renovation**, in the spiritual realm, is the assumption of Nicodemus
and many others, up to our very day. How can I adjust my life, make changes,
improve personally, etc. so that I can get from where I am now (which is pretty
messed up) to where I am pleasing to God? How can I renovate my life to get
where I want to be?

In contrast to renovation is **demolition**. Not too long after we left Florida,
that same building was sold again. And there was some uncertainly as to what
would become of it. One plan was for a healthcare-related facility, perhaps a
long-term care facility. If that were to happen, the entire building would need
to be demolished and rebuilt from the ground up. That change would simply be too
radical to just convert the existing building.

And this is what Jesus is saying to Nicodemus. “You can’t get to where you want
to be, Nicodemus, by renovating your life. You need to demolish and start over.
You need to start from scratch. You need to be born again.”

<!-- (4 minutes; 11.5 minutes total) -->

Now, what objection immediately arises when you hear that you have to start all
over? **“You can’t do that!”** Which is precisely Nicodemus’s response. _“How can a
man be born when he is old?”_ Some think here that Nicodemus is being really
dense, as if he thinks Jesus is literally proposing that one can somehow go back
through the birth canal. I really don’t think that’s the case. Remember what we
saw earlier about Nicodemus. This is the teacher of Israel; this is the dean of
the seminary. I think he
understands precisely what Jesus is saying and is just answering him in kind, in
keeping with the metaphor. “I hear what you’re saying, Jesus … you have to start
all over again. But you can’t do that!”

So, what does Jesus mean here? He presses on in verse 5. _“No one can enter the
kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth
to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.”_ This birth that Jesus is
talking about is of a totally different kind. Flesh gives birth to flesh. Human
effort isn’t enough. You need to start over by the Holy Spirit.

What Jesus is communicating here to Nicodemus is the good news of the
Gospel—that our salvation doesn’t depend on human effect but is based on what
God has accomplished in Christ. It is couched here in metaphor, to be sure, but
if we jump ahead to verse 16 it is explained plainly. (We’ll come back to verses
10–15 in a minute.) Jesus states:

> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
> believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

How does one start over, spiritually-speaking, so that one can have eternal life?
The answer is that, fundamentally, **it’s not about you**. It’s about what God has
done through Jesus, and we just need to believe. That’s how you start afresh.
That’s as far as this passage takes us, but we know from the rest of this gospel
how this comes about. We know that Jesus lives a life of perfect obedience to God the
father, what we could never do, and then takes the wrath of God—the wrath that
we deserve—upon himself on the cross, so that for those who believe in Jesus,
their sins are atoned for, they are satisfied through the sacrifice of Jesus.
You can’t get from where you are right now to where you need to be by measuring
up to a standard. You need a completely new start, a new identity, one that
comes from the Holy Spirit.

> Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone,
> the new is here! (2 Corinthians 5:17)

# Nicodemus doesn’t get it … do we?

Now if you’ve been paying attention, this isn’t the first time you’ve heard this
message in this church. We never want to get to a place in this church where we
**assume** the Gospel. It needs to me made explicit over and over again. Part of
that is because it forms the foundation for everything else. But another reason,
relevant to our passage this morning, is because people often need to hear the
Gospel many times before it “clicks”.

I grew up in this church, went to Sunday morning worship, Sunday school,
Treasure Club (pre-runner to Quest), in a home with Christian parents. The first
time I heard the Gospel was when I was in ninth grade. Now does this mean that
the Gospel was not announced in this church, or in my home, for 14 years? No, of
course not. But I didn’t have—as the Bible would put it—ears that could hear.

Our brains have this remarkable ability—this frustrating ability—to misprocess
information. It is happening right now. The sound waves are being transmitted,
vibrating the bones in the ear, all that stuff, and yet truth gets lost because
we have these filters in place, filters of distractions and invalid assumptions
that make us unable to hear truth.

So now let’s go back to verses 10 through 15 and consider our second question,
“Why is this so confusing to Nicodemus?” Jesus has stated this truth a couple of
times, and Nicodemus doesn’t get it. Jesus responds with a bit of an edge
starting in verse 10. His rebuke is, “You are supposed to be an expert in the
Scriptures; how can you not understand these things?” Because the necessity of
regeneration from above, of salvation being found by faith, is there in the Old
Testament. This isn’t something that Jesus invented in the New Testament. A
couple of examples:

> I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you
> your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. (Ezekiel 36:26)
>
> Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him, but the righteous
> shall live by his faith. (Habakkuk 2:4)
>
> Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. (Genesis
> 15:6)

And these are just some of the verses that we can cherry-pick and display
conveniently on a PowerPoint slide. Far more persuasive is the larger narrative,
the promises of a deliverer given in Genesis, the covenant with Abraham, the
symbolism of the sacrifices and festivals in the Law, etc.

When the whole of Scripture is considered, what Jesus is saying here makes
perfect sense. So why couldn’t Nicodemus, a scholar of the Old Testament, see
this? And I believe the answer is because he had an errant filter through which
he interpreted his study of the Scripture.

Here’s what we know about the Pharisees. They were devoted to properly
understanding God’s Law, but they also heavily relied on tradition and the
inherited expert opinion on the Law. So, they had not only the Old Testament,
but also lots of commentary on the Old Testament. And, as it happened, over
time—see if any of this sounds familiar—those traditions, and those expert
opinions came to have logical priority over the text of Scripture itself.

Thus, when Jesus speaks truth (that does line up with Scripture), the Pharisees
can’t understand. It doesn’t fit into their grid. In verse 11 Jesus says he’s
testifying to the truth, but they just don’t want to believe what he’s saying.
In verses 12 and 13 the implication seems to be that it was just too simple.
They wanted something complicated, some “deep” or “heavenly truth” that was
beyond the comprehension of the common folk. No, Jesus says, no one needs to go
up to heaven to get the secret decoder ring. Jesus descended to us to testify
about the father and salvation. And this message isn’t just for the spiritual
elite—it is meant to be understood by everyone.

<!-- (4.5 minutes; 19.5 minutes total) -->

Now here’s the kicker. We can be guilty—I can be guilty—of the exact same thing.
While claiming to believe in the supremacy of Scripture, it is easy to fall into
the trap of relying on tradition and expert opinion. To study a lot **about** the
Bible, without actually studying the Bible.

There are many ways this happens. We are awash in a sea of excellent spiritual
resources with Bible study guides, podcasts, books by gifted writers on relevant
life themes. We should be grateful for these resources, and should avail
ourselves of their use, but if we’re not careful we can end up giving them
priority of time and thought. Compounding that problem, we can find ourselves in
an echo chamber, where we are only hearing from sources that confirm what we
already assume to be true, or what we assume to be the most urgent issues.

This happens when we only listen to our favorite authors or speakers, or we
interpret Scripture solely in light of our denominational creeds, or through the
filter of social justice issues, or based on insights from modern psychology.
Again, solid resources have a place, and we should be thankful for and take
advantage of them. So don’t hear me saying this morning that those things are
bad. If you are in a small group right now and going through a Tim Keller book,
that’s great. All I’m saying is that, look, here we are at the end of a calendar
year, a good time to reflect. If you look back and can see that you’ve read a
dozen books by influential Christian thinkers, have listened faithfully to a
Christian podcast all year, but you never really got a daily Bible reading plan
off the ground, or actually studied a specific book of the Bible in-depth, maybe
that balance could be adjusted.

The danger is we become like the Pharisees, where there is a lot of genuine,
sincere study, but the actual voice of Scripture gets drowned out amidst the
pursuit of those other voices.

> But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of,
> because you know those from whom you learned it, and how from infancy you have
> known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through
> faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching,
> rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God
> may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:14–17)

# The snake in the wilderness

We‘ll close with the illustration that Jesus gives in verses 14 and 15.

Jesus makes an analogy from a story in Israel’s history. The event occurs
in the book of Numbers. If you recall the story, the Israelites were slaves in
Egypt, they have now escaped, and are wandering around the wilderness. And—as
they are prone to do—they start complaining against God. In response, God sends
venomous snakes among them, and many of the people are getting sick and dying.
They cry out to Moses, and God responds by providing a means for them to be
healed.

It’s kind of a bizarre thing, though. God could have just taken the snakes away
and healed everyone. That’s not outside of his power, and would be consistent
with his dealings in other places. Instead, he instructs Moses to craft a bronze
snake and place it amid the camp. If someone wanted to be healed, they had to
look at the snake. That’s it. All they had to do was believe God’s word about
healing coming through looking at the snake, and they would be healed.

And then the narrative in the Old Testament moves on. And it kind of leaves you scratching your head and
asking, “What was that whole snake thing about?” And I’m sure that people who
study the Bible far more than I have some great insights into that passage, but
I honestly think that the main reason that happened back then was so that it
pointed ahead to what Jesus would do later and be used as an illustration in this
very conversation with Nicodemus.

In the same way that the snake was lifted up, so also Jesus would be lifted up
on a cross. And in the same way that those who believed in God’s provision in
the snake would be saved, so also those who believe in God’s provision in Jesus
will be saved. And although we’re not told this explicitly, I’m sure there were
Israelites back in the snake-infested camp who refused to believe Moses that
looking at a bronze snake would heal them. Because it doesn’t make sense:
“That’s ridiculous. Everybody knows that looking at bronze statues doesn’t heal
sickness.” Or it goes against our sense of responsibility: “We got ourselves
into this mess by complaining. We have to get ourselves out of it by being more
religious in the future. Everybody knows that’s how it works. Looking at a
bronze snake is the easy way out.”

I hope that no one in this room finds yourself in that same situation of unbelief. The gospel
really is that simple. You can’t measure up to God’s perfect standard, you can’t
atone for the mistakes of your past, so Jesus paid the penalty for you and God
requires that we believe. That we have faith. Period.

Here’s what’s neat about this passage. Although Nicodemus comes across as kind
of a doofus in this passage, he comes around. There are only two other instances
in the Bible where we hear of Nicodemus. The next comes during a meeting of the
Pharisees, where they are accusing Jesus, and Nicodemus stands up for Jesus,
asserting that it’s not right to condemn a person without giving that person a
chance to defend themselves. That would have come at great personal cost. The
only other time we read of Nicodemus is after Jesus had died, when he came with
Joseph of Arimathea to bury the body of Jesus. By all accounts, Nicodemus was
able to get past his wrong filter, past his blind spots and wrong assumptions,
to hear the words of life from Christ. And he believed. And may that be true of
all of us as we move into a new year.
