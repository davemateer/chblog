Hello, my name is Dave Mateer. I am a Christian, husband, and father of five amazing children.

This blog is a place for me to record various thoughts, articles, and sermons I've written 
regarding the Bible and the Christian life. If you have stumbled across something here that points
you toward truth, I am happy to have been a small part of what God is using to advance His Kingdom. 

I don't pretend to have any unique insights[^1], but due to the way God has wired me to process
information, and my professional background, I do bring a certain perspective and emphasis. I have
worked as a software engineer for over 20 years. I feel blessed to be able to provide for
my family doing a job that lines up so well with the way God has created me to think. Software 
engineering requires—and constantly refines—an ability to think in logical terms, to sift through
the irrelevant and nonsensical to get to the bits that actually matter and connect them in a way
that builds a cohesive solution. So I suppose my "nonsense detector" may be a little more sensitive
than average, and most likely the thoughts on this site will reflect that bias.

The goal is always to have a spirit of Biblical love—even in times of criticism. You can be the 
judge whether or not I've been successful. One body, many gifts.

Again, thanks for reading, and may God bless you as you serve Him.
