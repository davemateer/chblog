Hello, my name is Dave Mateer. I am a Christian, husband, and father of five
amazing children.

This blog is a place for me to record various thoughts, articles, and sermons
I've written regarding the Bible and the Christian life. If you have stumbled
across something here that points you toward truth, I am happy to have been a
small part of what God is using to advance His Kingdom.

I don't pretend to have any unique insights, but due to the way God has wired me
to process information, and my work background, I suppose I do bring a certain
emphasis and bias. I have worked as a software engineer for over 20 years. I
feel blessed to be able to provide for my family doing a job I enjoy and that
lines up so well with the way God has created me to think. Software engineering
requires—and constantly refines—one‘s ability to think in logical terms, to
connect the relevant information in a way that builds a cohesive, efficient, and
(hopefully!) error-free solution. That process inevitably influences the way I
approach the study of Scripture. So probably a little low on the emotional,
rhetorically-impressive side of things, and more “just the facts, ma‘am". You‘ve
been warned.

Again, thanks for reading, and may God bless you as you serve Him.
